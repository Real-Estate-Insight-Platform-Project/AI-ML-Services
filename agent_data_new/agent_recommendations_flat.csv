We would like to take moment to comment on the extraordinary service we received from our realtor, Nancy Muslin, of Long Reality.  Prior to the listing of our home in Sun City Grand, Surprise, AZ, we began a search and watch of various realtors selling homes in our local area.  Our interest began to peak regarding one realtor in particular, Nancy Muslin.  She was very active listing homes in our area and we noticed homes under her responsibility began to sell above the average cost per square foot for equal sized homes.  After our first interview with Nancy, we knew she was the right person to represent our home.  That first interview with Nancy quickly resolved all concerns.  Nancy addressed any required home tune-ups, and established a very acceptable pricing range.  Within days after signing with Nancy as our realtor, Nancy began a sales program that took us by surprise.  She immediately incorporated a staging program, began weekly open houses, and kept us informed weekly regarding web site visits, open house visitor counts and more.   Our home went on the open market September 9, and was sold to a very ‘clean’ buyer on October 27, seven weeks after the open market listing and within 3% of our asking price.  We could not be more pleased with the sale of our home and we strongly recommend Nancy Muslin, to anyone to be your home sale representative.

She was friendly, professional, and presented me with useful background information about her, the area, trending real estate prices, recent sales, recommendations for contractors for any last-minute repairs and freshening up of the property, and a realistic price.  She personally helped me to de-clutter my home and then staged the home beautifully with many of her own pieces to accent the best qualities of my home.  She brought in a professional photographer who took gorgeous pictures for the listing and brochures.  She brought me a buyer with a few days who had told his agent that he had to see this house that he saw on the internet.  Yes, he bought my house!

She knows Gold Canyon and makes it a point to know EVERYTHING   there was to know about the market and our competition. We ask a lot of questions and she had the answers immediately, there was no going to someone else to confirm or ask. One of the most important things we asked was the timing of selling our house since we could be flexible.  Robin showed us the market trends and how they would affect the process.  This is the sort of expertise we were looking for.  We were absolutely thrilled by the complimentary staging she did.  The professional twilight photos she had done of our house were inspiring. It was front and center showing at its best. It made us fall in love with our own house all over again and question wanting to sell it.  We never felt like Robin was trying to price it to get a quick sale or to not have to spend time marketing it. She is a work horse who treats every house like it is her own home. She doesn't just talk the talk, she sells homes!  We had never worked with a team approach before and her team is amazing. Arlene, Kellie and Joe were all fantastic too!  Being out of state and in a different time zone; there was ALWAYS someone available to answer a question.  We never had a worry because she is on the ball.  Robin and her team go the extra mile from the time she meets with you to the closing and beyond.  Our house was in ""excellent hands"" when we listed it and all throughout the sales process. Since we were not there, someone from her office made sure they coordinated any inspections or repairs that were required.  We also trusted her to get us the best price possible.  She is a master negotiator and that is coming from someone who negotiates multi-million dollar deals and is hard to impress. We felt she was always on our side and appreciated her candid and honest answers.  We felt like we were always on the same page as far as that goes. No question was ever treated as unimportant. We weren't familiar with the process in Arizona since it had changed over the years and she educated us so we knew what to expect. She had a roster of competent, reliable and fair tradespeople to get our home into tip top shape. We appreciated her so much that we will ask her to recommend a realtor to sell our primary home and refer us to a realtor in our new city if necessary. If you want a winner to sell your home and look out for your best interests, call Robin today! I promise you will be blown away like we were and more importantly your home WILL sell!",user11919617,,,,2016,2016-08-17T06:00:00.000Z,2018-07-30T16:38:53.164Z,RDC,http://ap.rdcpix.com/1158972086/dd7883413eb19f8404907dd42d7cef62q-c0s.jpg,

Summary of their experience
 We were first time home buyers who were not sure what we were looking for. We also did not know much about the home buying process. Another agent recommended Kathleen and we decided to meet with her. From the first time we met, it was clear that Kathleen is a professional who cares deeply about her clients. She took the time to educate us on the process, and helped us to determine what we should be looking for. After looking through a few listings, Kathleen showed us a few homes. She was very accommodating with her schedule and was willing to meet whenever it worked best for us. We loved the homes that we saw, and decided to do a second tour of the first house we visited. The second tour sealed the deal for us, and we decided to put in an offer. This is a testament to her expertise at finding us a home that exactly matched what we had in mind. From there, she helped us come up with an offer, which was countered and we accepted the same day. Her strategy for the offer worked great, as we got the home for less than the list price, and also much less than we thought. From there on, Kathleen helped set us up with inspectors, the lawyer, and also helped us work with the lender right through closing. Throughout the entire process, Kathleen was very responsive via both cell and email. I would highly recommend Kathleen because of her experience, knowledge, ability to educate, responsiveness, and moreover, because she produced a great result for us.

Professionalism, knowledgeable, expert negotiator, patience and personality. Kathleen is the total package. My wife and I are first time homebuyers. After doing some online research, Kathleen's name stuck out above the others. She came highly reviewed...and now I know why. The things we love most about Kathleen include her ability to work with our schedule. We often met her late at night, when the other agents had already left. Kathleen stays. Her communication is top notch. Always easy to get a hold of. Texting, calling and e-mailing. Always available to answer our many questions and update us. Kathleen will be you're housing ally and secret weapon negotiator. She doesn't pressure you into anything. She is happy when you are happy. Her sixth sense in negotiations saved us money when the sellers counter-offered and we stayed firm. When the home inspection revealed deal-breaker issues, Kathleen's expertise resulted in the sellers agreeing to pay for all the costly repairs. Buying a home is stressful, but Kathleen will guide you through the process step-by-step. Ethics is often overlooked in real-estate, but TRUST is HUGE. I am a journalist, so trust and credibility are important to me. Kathleen has always been honest with us. We enjoy getting to know her as both a real-estate professional and a person. She gives you that personal touch and makes us feel like family. If you want someone who takes personal pride in being the BEST at what they do, Kathleen should be your agent for life. She certainly will be for us. « less ",Matt and Amanda Caron,,,,2016,2016-02-22T07:00:00.000Z,2018-07-27T20:29:14.395Z,RDC,,

She has a lot of knowledge about the process and expert negotiation skills. She wasn't afraid to take a hardline with the seller, which she often had to do in my case.

Agent Selected Because: We originally selected her because she was the listing agent of a house we wanted to see. We then continued to use her as our agent because of her honesty, knowledge and professionalism. She is also extremely personal and prompt with responses.



Company Selected Because: We chose Berkshire because that is who Kathleen works for. 



Most Memorable: Kathleen was absolutely most memorable about our buying and selling experience. She answered all of our questions without getting annoyed and guided us every step of the way. Kathleen pointed out both positives and negative about each property, which we loved. When we were selling our condo, Kathleen brought in her own, personal furniture to help stage our condo. Her and her family moved all of the items in and out on their own, without ever asking for assistance. We absolutely love Kathleen and would recommend her to anyone who is looking to buy or sell property. 



Addl. Comments: Kathleen Sitek is by far the best agent that we have ever dealt with. She is exceptionally knowledgeable, honest and personable. Now that we have bought our house and sold our condo through Kathleen, we really miss seeing and talking to her every week. I STRONGLY recommend Kathleen to anyone who is need of her services

She made a slew of suggestions regarding the staging and the initial sales price and had the home looking its best with the awesome photos she took of the property and the description thereof. The house sold in a very short period of time because of her knowledge, expertise and gold star reputation. Personally, I have been teetering about selling my house for some time. What I truly love about Kathleen is that she advises you as if you were a family member. She doesn't push you into selling your home; she gives you all the positives and negatives that she sees with your individual situation I ultimately decided not to sell my home right now, but when I eventually move to Florida when I retire, picking my selling agent will be a no brainer!! I only wish she could be the agent in Florida that I'll use to help me find a house!!

Buying a house was new to both my girlfriend and I so we had a million questions and Kathleen was there any time of day to give us the answers we needed. If she did not have the answer right then she would find it out and call us back no matter time or day. Both my girlfriend and I have very scattered work schedules but that didn't matter to Kathleen. She would make the changes in her day to accommodate both of us and get the necessary things accomplished. Without having Kathleen as our agent we would have been left in the dark. All the things that come with buying a house that a buyer should be aware of Kathleen was always one step ahead and got us what we needed.

I had originally listed my home with a family friend, thinking that because they knew me, they’d give my home extra attention. This was not the case. I soon learned that not all realtors or realty companies are the same. Through research and recommendations from  friends, I quickly found Adam and The Oldfather Group. Their marketing and advertising abilities blew any other realty company out of the water as they were able to offer me so much more. Adam knew so much about staging, what angles the photographer should take, how to get more views on Zillow and get my home closer to the top of the listings. I was immediately impressed with his knowledge and experience. He really pulled out all the stops. After my home was relisted with Adam, we had consistent showings— at least once a week if not more. A couple weeks later (and a week before Christmas), we had our buyer. We had never sold a home before and Adam was so thorough in explaining everything to us and made sure that we understood what was going on every step of the way. Adam was very friendly, professional and in constant communication with me. He even called me with updates while he was on his Christmas vacation. Adam was extremely dedicated and gave 110% from start to finish. Due to our work schedule, we were unable to attend settlement so we arranged to sign our docs a few days ahead of time. Even though our part was done, Adam still attended settlement, just to make sure that everything went well. He was constantly exceeding our expectations throughout the whole process. I will forever be grateful for Adam for selling our home and making this a great experience for us.",mollym,dustin@theoldfathergroup.com,,,,2020-01-28T15:54:03.935Z,2020-01-28T17:15:42.968Z,RDC,,

We made many, many requests for his professional opinion related to areas at the beach that would be the most desireable for us and he gave us so  many options in so many areas.  He knew what we wanted and found many options for us to see and evaluate.  We did make three offers.  The first was for a house that was found to be in a flood zone.  We loved the house but we had to withdraw due to the very high price quoted for flood insurance.  The second was withdrawn for a house in Milton because the seller was not willing to wait for the sale of our home.  He was not very ameniable and would have been our closest neighbor.

This Real Estate professional was excellent.  She took the time to hear what we were looking for and delivered.

My wife and I had been considering the purchasing of a house in the Delaware market for quite some time. We looked on Zillow and used another agency to look at the market and help us through the process as we started  looking in the market from an out-of-state prospectus. At that time we decided to  put the project on hold. 
            several months later we had the opportunity to meet Jeff Hecker at The Oldfather Group of Ocean Atlantic Sotheby's International Realty . Jeff took the time to listen to what we were looking for and understood the price range and the amenities we expected to find in our new house. Jeff took us to several locations to include new houses, new developments, and even some show houses for us to get a feel for the type of construction and the market area. We were not looking to sell a house, we were just looking to buy a beach house for the summer months and special occasions. 
            
            It was a pleasure to work with Jeff because of his knowledge and experience in the market. It had been 30+ years since we purchased a new house let alone one in another state. Jeff supported us through the entire process from walk-throughs in the construction process And the final walk-through as well as the settlement process. He made us feel comfortable and was very knowledgeable of the process.
            
            If and when the time comes we were to consider selling our property and upgrading Jeff and The Oldfather Group of Ocean Atlantic Sotheby's International Realty Group Will be our realtors of choice for the process!",smokeystover4,dustin@theoldfathergroup.com,,,,2020-01-28T15:43:34.435Z,2020-01-28T17:14:49.704Z,RDC,,

As a first time home buyer AND someone who would be moving from several states away AND someone who had a pretty specific (read: picky) vision of the 'beach life' she wanted to have - Celia had her work cut out for her.  But the moment I met her, I knew I had the right person on my team.  She was  incredibly knowledgeable of the community and what properties were available.  She made sure to respect what I wanted but also advocated for me to have the right property that would be a smart decision in every regard (i.e. as my home, an investment, great location, etc). And when I found ""the one"", she made it happen at the right price and a contract I felt completely comfortable with.  Celia is who you want in your corner when you're navigating this process, and to top it all off, she's just a whole lot of fun.  
            
            The team from The Oldfather Group conducted themselves with honesty and integrity, and I always had the support and guidance I needed, every step of the way.  The entire process was made incredibly smooth and truly joyful...nothing like the procedural and logistical nightmare I've heard of from others who have gone through the home buying experience.  
            
            I am truly grateful for the service and support they provided throughout this time in our lives.

It was truly a pleasure having Julie as our agent when we purchased our new coastal home. It has been 42 years since we last moved - needless to say - purchasing a new home in 2019 was, at times, a challenge, but Julie was so knowledgable, efficient and always professional during our purchase.  Julie was very responsive to any concerns we had and truly confident having her represent us as we searched for our new home and throughout the purchase. Julie made us feel special (just like family) during our purchase. We are looking forward to enjoying our new coastal home with family and friends.

We were moving in from out of state and were looking for a home that would suit the needs of three generations (ages 7 to 70). Our agent, Amy Pietlock, listened to our needs and concerns and helped us find the home for which we had been searching for five years. Amy was professional, knowledgeable,  friendly and patient as we visited many potential homes.
            
            Once we found the home that best suited our needs, Amy was indispensable in helping us through the process of securing a mortgage, setting up utilities and other services which would have been difficult to do on our own as we were unfamiliar with the area and were handling the process from out of state.
            
            Amy was always available to us by phone, text or email to help us with whatever we needed. We constantly put her knowledge of the area to use and were never made to feel that we were imposing on her time. 
            
            On a personal level, Amy is warm and friendly and made us feel that she was genuinely happy that we finally found our ""forever"" home.

If you are looking for a real estate agent… you can stop looking now because I promise you that Jeff Hecker is who you want to work with- he is hands down the best!  We were looking for a beach retreat in Delaware as a second home and we were so fortunate to connect with Jeff!  We had some general  ideas of the type and location of the property we wanted, as well as a budget and amenities.  Jeff really listened to what we were looking for and spent the time showing us a bunch of different properties that met our needs.  Jeff carefully guided us to the right developments (and steered us away from others) knowing that we may want to utilize the property as a vacation rental. He ended up finding us the perfect beach home and we are delighted! Jeff is very in tune with his buyers, he is not only personable but he’s analytical too, which is a tremendous asset in a real estate agent. When we narrowed it down to 2 houses, Jeff did a market analysis on each of them to help us make an informed decision. He was a tough but fair negotiator, helping us secure a purchase price under market value. Jeff communicated with both my husband and I, keeping us informed every step of the way, and made us feel like we were his only client.
            
            When you hire Jeff, not only do you get a fabulous realtor, but you also get to work with his awesome closing team at the Oldfather Group.  They were great at handling every detail of our transaction.  Our closing was quick and easy and we were able to close within 30 days!
            
            If I need a real estate agent again, Jeff is my go-to guy!  His greatest attribute, he listens and then asks thought provoking questions which insures you get what you really want. Put your trust in Jeff, it will pay off! He is a class act! We LOVE our getaway at the beach! ",jillb7,dustin@theoldfathergroup.com,,,,2020-01-28T15:11:25.589Z,2020-01-28T17:12:33.099Z,RDC,,

            Diana did such a great job helping us find the right home that we  naturally turned to her again when we needed to sell it. She once again demonstrated her abilities and hard work ethic in arranging for the sale.

April 2019:  I have moved into my new house and want to take this opportunity to reiterate what a smooth process it was working with Julie and Erika at The Oldfather Group in Rehoboth DE.  I only have purchased one other house and that was 22 years ago so was very nervous about doing this again,  especially with my current move being long distance.  Julie and Erika would answer any questions I had immediately.  I felt well informed of the process at every point.   I am very thankful for Julie's folIow up after the closing to make sure all was well and providing recommendations for services (plumber/painter, etc.).  I love my new home and hope to never have to move again, but if I do I would go right back to Julie.  
            Feb 2019:  Julie was very responsive to my inquiries regarding available properties for sale and arranged showings during my brief visits to the area.  She provided me a wealth of information of the area in general as I am from out of state.

There my fiancee and I meet Jeff.  He introduced himself and fully explained that he represented the seller. He  asked if we would like to work with him at that time. We stated we would.  He explained all that he was responsible for and what we could expect from him. The property we looked at meet our criteria but when we put in an offer it didn't work out. Jeff assured us something else would come along and not to worry. I again began looking online and Jeff began searching as well. We found another place and Jeff set up the walk through. I was ready to place an offer.  He had us sign offer papers right there and headed back to the office to contact the selling Realtor.  He was right on top of it, we had an answer in just a few days.  The start of our purchase began and Jeff suggested a mortgage company. He also returned to the property several times alone and with us through out the process of purchasing the property. He was always just a call away. Jeff was in contact with me regularly and was very supportive.  We went to settlement and Jeff was right there with us.  He had a house warming gift as well.

I cannot say enough about our experience with Cynthia. She was absolutely fantastic. She fully understands the Ocean City environment. We were looking for a condo with an ocean view. She understood the buildings and the location such that she was infinitely helpful with what our life would be like  after the purchase. That helped as we were narrowing down choices. 
            
            Her negotiating skills were excellent. We purchased from an individual selling ""for sale by owner"" and doing a 1031 transaction so she had to ensure that all the details between us were properly attended to and administered.
            
            We had a particularly difficult time with our lender and she was able to keep the seller engaged and open to adjustments with the close date. In this regard she was truly fantastic and helpful to both the seller and my wife and I.
            
            Lastly, she ensured we had a place to stay when we visited to get business done no matter what the time of year. She utilized her connections to ensure we could be accommodated.
            
            My wife and I are happy to have had her on our side the entire time and we are happy to say that we've added her as a friend for life. ",1081171,dustin@theoldfathergroup.com,,,,2020-01-27T20:26:55.119Z,2020-01-28T17:10:25.228Z,RDC,,

What a pleasure it was to work with our friend Bob and the Oldfather Group. Bob was more than just our realtor, he remains our friend and also happened to be our neighbor. As first time home sellers, Bob took the time and care we needed to help us understand the home selling process, strategize on  negotiations, find us buyers with which we felt comfortable selling our first home, and ultimately helped us seamlessly walk through the closing process. My wife and I had to relocate across country during the selling process which was stressful to say the least. However, with Bob as our advocate and with support of the wonderful team at Oldfather, we were able to work remotely and find the perfect couple for our home. Bob even took the extra effort to stage the home in a way that uniquely showcased the love we had for the property. As an added bonus, Bob used one of his valuable Saturdays at no extra expense to host an estate sale on our behalf so we wouldnt have to move as much of our property across the country. Bob was always willing to quickly respond to a text or jump on a call to answer my many questions which immediately solidified my faith and trust in him.

She had three homes to show me while on vacation at Trap Pond  State Park. Cindy and her husband made me feel like we were family. She had three homes in  place. She found out the style and  the things I wanted in a home. I wasn't sure I could afford anything in the Bethany area. She had me get my things at home in order. Kept sending me homes  on the computer to see. Then it happened. I found one. I kept going back to this home. On April 15th Cindy said, come on up.  She showed me this little house I loved and two other homes. The feelings were for the little home. Cindy gave up the following Sunday where she had a appointment for her hair to put a contract on the house. The family selling is on vacation. I am so excited I can hardly wait.

435398,988b9398-4590-420e-b094-4813cd86cca1,,"5-Stars: 04/13/2018 - Bought a Single Family home in 2018 in Centreville, VA. Review for Member: Elaine Rellihan. In approximately October 2017, we began looking for homes in the Delmarva Peninsula, as we were planning our retirement.  We can say without a shadow of a doubt that Elaine has persevered with us and has shown us nothing but patience, professionalism and wise counsel from the time we first met  her.
            
            We turned out not to be the average homebuyers since we had not yet planned a move date and we were taking our time to find a home that suited us best.  We understand that the average homebuyer usually finds a house within approximately 10 showings.  We are obviously fussier than the average buyer and I have spent many hours online looking at homes as well at the ones Elaine sent us from her searches.
            
            To date, Elaine has shown us about sixty-two (62) homes, five of which we viewed two or three times.  This took an extraordinary amount of work on her part as well as patience with us.  She was always ready with fact sheets with which she had already made herself familiar and disclosure statements for all houses that we held some interest in.  We made several offers that didn’t work out for us including one where the seller wanted to bargain no further and insisted upon the advertised price.  This was after two separate contract offers on two separate occasions for the same house in Lewes, DE.  Elaine was extremely adept at writing offers, working with sellers' agents and leading us through the sometimes grueling offer and bargaining process.  There were also many occasions where Elaine promptly and efficiently handled all our questions and facilitated the back and forth of questions and answers on at least a half dozen of the homes we viewed which drew our interest.  We always had many questions about any of the properties we were interested in usually asked for more documentation which Elaine facilitated.  In addition, she conducted research for us on relevant regulations and HOA requirements regarding pools and ponds we desired to build on prospective homes.  She contacted county offices for issues such as septic systems and she sent us links of available services in the area.  Elaine even asked pool and construction experts to meet and talk with us on-site when we were viewing the respective houses a second or third time.
            
            We could go on and describe further instances where Elaine showed her professionalism and integrity such as the time she spent the whole of a Sunday afternoon (we more often came to Delaware to view houses on Sundays) with a builder and sat with us, answered our questions and provided us with perspectives as we tried to determine whether we wanted a new home built and the associated costs based on available options.  This was after viewing several other homes in the morning.
            
            In our view, Elaine went above the call of duty to ensure that we find the right home that we can be totally happy with.  I would recommend her to any of my friends and associates without any hesitation or reservation.  Her professionalism and the caretaking of her clients is nothing short of extraordinary.  Elaine has and will always be our real estate agent anywhere in Delaware for as long as we continue the search for a suitable home; we would want no other agent than Elaine Rellihan.",ilir85t,dustin@theoldfathergroup.com,,,,2020-01-15T19:50:43.479Z,2020-01-28T17:07:13.092Z,RDC,,

Celia is the reason we have the beach home we love today; she is way ahead of her real estate peers, reviewing the listings every morning at 4:30 a.m., getting a jump on houses that have just hit the market before others.

She always kept us informed of every detail during the entire process. She was very helpful in recommending any local services we came in need of during the sale.

In response to your request, I would be pleased to provide feedback on efforts of Celia Benjamin to assist and guide us in the process of finding a “getaway” beach home in the Rehoboth Beach area.  
            
            We had some general ideas of the style and location of the property we wanted, as well as a budget.   Satisfying any one or two of these elements was fairly easy; finding a property that met all three criteria turned out to be a daunting task.  Not to mention that we as a couple were not always in agreement with each other in our rating of potential properties.
            
            Celia was relentless in satisfying our evolving requirements; as our criteria changed, she redirected our search for new properties to meet our newly perceived needs.  Her rapid response to our queries and willingness to meet us almost anytime and anywhere made us feel like we were her only client.  
            
            Over several months we visited a large number of properties throughout the Rehoboth Beach area.
            
            Once we narrowed our choices, Celia was a strong advocate for our interests.  We eventually decided to buy a newly constructed townhome, and Celia made sure that we received all the available incentives and price concessions from the builder.
            
            Celia was an enthusiastic partner in the search for our new “getaway,” but was always sensitive to our fears and reservations, never pushing us to compromise on our fundamental requirements. 
            
            We could not have been more pleased with the real estate services provided by Celia, and would recommend her without reservation. 
            
            And it goes without saying that Celia, along with being exceedingly competent and highly motivated, is a delightful and personable individual, and a real asset to your organization.

Buyers/sellers : IF YOU ARE A POTENTIAL or NEW BUYER (OR SELLER) OF A HOME or PROPERTY IN SUSSEX COUNTY DELAWARE - AND LOOKING FOR AN AGENT OR AGENCY WITH INTEGRITY -YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A BETTER PERSON THAN CHUCK SEAMAN AND THE OLD FATHER GROUP - PERIOD....!!!! YOUR SEARCH FOR AN  AGENT NEEDS TO GO NO FURTHER - READ BELOW - 
            
            Chuck Seaman worked with my wife and I on several properties during our search for land in Sussex county Delaware. Chuck's knowledge was quite impressive, he was responsive, and although we never completed a deal with Chuck  (NO fault of Chuck's AT ALL) he certainly went out of his way to try and push our offers through. Chuck was able to find out and communicate intimate details on a number of properties that allowed us to make good business decisions on whether to make an offer or not. Chuck is VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE of the area, and its history, which played to our favor. Chuck also has a way about him that makes him comfortable to work with (unlike other agents who were like used car salesman/woman). It should be further noted that Chuck understood he worked for us, as our agent, and no matter the offer we made - Chuck acted in our best interest.
            
            My wife and I were involved in a bidding war on a piece of property that went back and forth for over a week. There were several peculiarities on the deed restrictions and the person who would enforce these restrictions. With Chuck's coaching and additional investigation, my wife and I decided to walk away from this deal - something that we owe a debt of gratitude to Chuck (I would prefer not giving details here) but the fact that Chuck was more interested in ensuring our needs were met vs. lining his pockets shows a man of integrity.  
                                                                            
            Knowing what our needs were, as well as our personalities - Chuck took great care in choosing an agent (Bryan Powers - see more of his review) during the time that Chuck was on vacation. We eventually found a property,  that met our needs at our price, and Bryan and the Old Father group came through in the end. Chuck was kind enough to give of his time to attend our settlement.        
            
            Prior to our association with Chuck, and the Old Father group; My wife and I had ""FIRED"" a total of 4 other agents / agencies, due to their attitudes, lack of responsiveness,  general disposition toward our purchase requirements, and complete disinterest in meeting our needs, (i.e. other agencies were more interested in showing us properties in areas we were either NOT interested in, or listed at values we simply could not afford, or both;  Analogy- wanting to line their respective pockets at our families expense). I point this out in this particular review and will say it again: IF YOU ARE A POTENTIAL BUYER (OR SELLER) OF A HOME OF PROPERTY IN SUSSEX COUNTY DELAWARE - AND LOOKING FOR AN AGENT OR AGENCY WITH INTEGRITY -YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND BETTER PERSON THAN CHUCK SEAMAN AND THE OLD FATHER GROUP - PERIOD....!!!!     
            
            The owners of the Old Father group should be proud to have agent like Chuck on their team.

I can't say enough about Sherry Thens and Steph Moyer!  From the first interaction, they treated me with the priority of their #1 client!  Sherry listened to exactly what I was looking for in my dream property and was able to meet with me the following weekend.  She was very accommodating and  provided all the information needed to make a good decision.  Sherry was always responsive to my questions and went the extra mile to find out as much information as possible.  
            
            Steph provided me with all the information to work through the settlement!  Like Sherry, she was always responsive.  They were both very professional, so proactive and right on the ball at all times. They had answers as I was thinking of the questions!

Christine MacSyn was very friendly and responsive to questions I raised and represented me well with the seller's agent.  The only  difficulty was that I purchased a property that needed and FHA 203K renovation mortgage, and Christine was unfamiliar with the requirements of that type of mortgage.   I was a first time home buyer depending on her expertise and we both learned about the process as slogged through it.  That said, she is no longer inexperienced in the process and I can highly recommend her as real estate agent. 

Response from Dustin Oldfather on 07/06/2017
Congratulations home owner! :-) We are so happy for you! Yes, in this area 203k loans are very tricky and not many lenders are proficient with them, but I am so happy Christine was able to battle through for you and get to settlement. Looking forward to seeing you in-town! Warm Regards, Dustin

Review for Member: Dustin Oldfather. My wife and I recently purchased our first home in Lewes Delaware.  The level of service we received from our agent, Dan Mills of the Oldfather Group, was nothing short of spectacular.  From start to finish, Dan was responsive, patient, and demonstrated a deep knowledge of the local real estate  market.  His attention to detail and ""outside of the box"" approach to purchasing a home in a competitive resort-based market was critical to our successful purchase of a beautiful home.  If you are on the hunt for a new home along the Delaware coast, we highly recommend contacting Dan Mills to help you navigate these waters!

Review for Member: Dustin Oldfather. Dan Mills helped us with everything. Dan always called me back right after I had any questions immediately. One of the most responsive people I have had the pleasure of dealing. His knowledge of the area impressed us also. Between the future plans of stores and businesses and the prices of most of  the real estate for sale and knowledge of the developments. I feel we are very fortunate to have meet Dan and not only for steering us to 32880 Pelican. He stayed in constant  contact with us and our numerous questions about the previous owner, prices of similiar development, and about the true value of what we were looking at. I loved talking to him on other issues as well. Like the bigger picture for De and Millsboro and the surrounding areas. I also liked his history and his education. Dan is a gem in many ways. His knowledge, education, and virtues like kindness , and love for the people he is doing business with............

We responded to a listing and Dan Mills from the Oldfather Group called me within a few minutes.  He was very helpful and informative right from the start.  We were looking for a second home and in addition to the one we had inquired about he found several more for us to look at that first Saturday  to give us a good idea of what we liked and didn't like.  After our offer was excepted Dan did everything and more I could have looked for in an agent.  He went to the inspection for us since we live 2.5 hours away and we couldn't be there.  We did hit a major snag when the seller passed away two weeks before settlement and the quick progress we were making was halted.  Even then Dan continued to go above and beyond, at one point calling me every day to give me an update even when there wasn't much to update.  Unfortunately, Dan had his vacation scheduled for the week we went to settlement but Christine Macysyn  stepped in for the last few days and made us feel like she had been our agent all along.  All in all our experience with the Oldfather Group, Dan and Christine was outstanding.  If I ever need a realtor in Lewes I will be contacting Dan and I would give him (and the Oldfather Group) six stars if I could.  I could not have asked for more from a realtor.

I searched on Zillow for a realtor that seemed to be involved with as many sold real estate sales as possible in the price range that we were looking for.  Oldfather Group was the company that I saw everywhere.  So i replied to a posting and was contacted by Adam Linder.  He turned out to be a  great realtor with alot of local experience.  We weren't sure what we wanted:  condo, town home or single family home.  New or re-sale.  So he showed us everything.  Once we decided on going with a new home - new construction, he showed us several communities and stood by us when we were asking about pricing and options.  When we found the home that we wanted and went through the entire process from offer to closing, Adam was with us every step of the way.  I would highly recommend Oldfather Group[ and Adam to anyone considering buying a home or condo in the Sussex County Delaware area. Less

He made many trips to the condo I purchased to make sure that estimates were given for repairs that needed to be done before settlement.

I was having a conversation with a co-worker the other day and we were talking about our opinions on the best realtor in the beach area.  Many names were thrown around, there are so many good ones...... and we actually both landed on Adam from the Oldfather group. The ironic thing is he is fairly new to the business here but he's like some kind of an anomaly. He is sharp as a tack, responsive, has a level of work ethic that is unreal. Oh and he is really funny and overall just a pleasure to be around. 

I have heard the same praises about him from co-workers. Working for a builder....It's common for me to hear clients say that realtors ""push their own resales"" and pick and choose what they want to hear from their clients...basically showing what they want to sell instead of what the clients actually need. This goes against everything we have all been taught in the industry. “Selling” is about asking questions and understanding needs and actually caring. Those of us who love what we do take this seriously. Adam gets it. 
            The great thing about this review is that so many ppl love Adam, when he reads this he will have absolutely  no idea who wrote it.  Lol

After no activity on the sale of our house we switched realtors and went to the Oldfather Group.  What a great decision. Their professionalism and marketing approach, were instrumental in bringing in a wide range of potential purchasers which culminated in the sale of our house.  From great  pictures which showed our house beautifully to multiple linkages to web sites, the sales campaign was thorough and fantastic. The Oldfather Group is the best and are highly recommended.

Thank you so much Jan! We really appreciate it... Dustin",Jan I.,Ellis@theoldfathergroup.com,,,,2019-12-17T22:29:01.501Z,2020-01-28T16:25:29.852Z,RDC,,
435398,3d1fcea8-42e3-4b84-beba-bc4afa3edaa8,,"03/18/2014 - Bought a Single Family home in 2014 in Bethany Beach, DE. Review for Member: Mariya Oldfather. We recently purchased a beach home using the Oldfather Group to represent us.  The entire process was great!

First, Mariya got us set up on the The OldFather Group MLS Search website, a crucial tool for finding our new home.  After setting up several searches by drawing circles on a map around the areas we were interested in, it became super easy to get daily emails of new listings in those areas.  Cheryl made certain our searches were correct and included everything we were looking for.  When we would request additional info on a specific home, the Team would respond quickly.

The Oldfather MLS search web site is much better than Zillow or Trulia.  When a home disappears from the Oldfather Web Site, it is off the market!  Zillow and Trulia do not work this way.  Zillow and Trulia both will list homes as for sale long after they come off the market.  We were confused at first, as we kept finding interesting homes on Zillow that were already sold.  Mariya helped to explain what were were experiencing, and got us to the point where we could be confident that the homes we were finding were indeed available.  So the web site was crucial for finding potential  homes.

Mariya and her team have excellent knowledge of the entire market place.  Mariya can work with any budget, and repeatedly brought important facts and considerations to our attention as we reviewed properties.  Mariya explained to us typical pricing groups for the areas we were interested in, explaining what more or less money would typically buy.  She communicated the ins and outs of each neighborhood we looked at, including neighborhood quirks, flood plain concerns, neighborhood/locale plusses and minuses, and the rental potential for properties under consideration.  She was even able to get a former contractor/home inspector and the local zoning office on the phone for feedback as we considered a property that would have needed some renovation/improvements to see if what we thinking was in-budget and allowable in the municipality being considered.

During our home search, Mariya was extremely responsive.  As a family, we tend to utilize texting and email for fast communication, and Mariya was able to match our tempo and preferred communication style.  Mariya was also excellent on the phone, so while she can certainly work with tech savvy buyers, she communicates well regardless of your technical bias.

When we expressed pointed interest in a particular neighborhood, Mariya and her team put together a great looking color mailer and sent it out to the property owners in that area, asking anyone interested in selling to please contact her office.

The entire team at The Oldfather Group is outstanding.  We knew we'd move fast once we found the right home, and Mariya's team made certain we could!  In what was an amazingly fast buying process (15 days from initial walk through till we had the keys in our hands!), Mariya's team kept us apprised of everything happening, and assisted us in making sure our responsibilities were completed.  They offered us referrals to  excellent vendors for survey, inspection, insurance, and closing.  Mariya's team actually picked up the ball when it was dropped by the listing agent, and made certain that the sellers took care of their responsibilities to allow closing to move forward.

Of course, we wouldn't have been able to close on our house if the sellers hadn't of accepted our offer!  Acting as our agent, Mariya sold our deal to the listing agent as the best deal they had, and we had a prompt response from the sellers.  When we found a few surprises during the inspection, worked to negotiate a deal that allowed us to close on the house and, using cash from the seller, fix the problems found after taking possession.

We are very happy with our purchase, and were very pleased by the skills, professionalism and attention shared with us by The Oldfather group.

Everyone in the Oldfather Group, no matter their level of involvement with our particular home purchase, worked as a team, and made our experience not only successful, but seamless & enjoyable as well.

As we were living  several hundred miles away, we had to rely on email, phone & fax to communicate with the builder, mortgage lender & others.  The staff at the Oldfather Group proved invaluable as our liaison, as well as providing excellent referrals to local insurance agents and a building inspector.

Our agent, Chuck Seaman, reached out to us when we first began looking on Zillow, Trulia and other sources of real estate info. He was most helpful, spending hours, showing us different areas - all within our budget. Chuck was extremely knowledgable about the various communities in our target area  and he helped us thoughtfully find just the right property. With Maria Oldfather and the rest of her team, we quickly negotiated a very favorable deal - for us - all, while multiple other offers we're being considered by the seller!

My wife and I recently had a wonderful experience with the team of Mariya Oldfather and Nancy Capps.  We live in PA and had little knowledge of the current home market in the Lewes/Rehoboth DE area.  After describing our interests to Mariya, she showed us a well-selected set of properties, answered  our many questions, effectively described the home market and guided us through the process.  Mariya is a good listener and responded quickly to our requests, many of them via email and texting since we were out of town.  Nancy helped guide us through the steps leading up to an uneventful close.

I am a big fan of Dave Ramsey as I listen to his show most every day.When we decided to sell our house, I wanted to check out Dave's ELP in the Bethany Beach Delaware area.We had a contract on our house within 3 months of employing the Oldfather Group.Settlement was to be in another 3 months or  so.They were everything you would want in a real estate sales team.They would return phone calls asap.We relied on texting info back and forth alot of the time and they would always respond within minutes in most every instance. It did not matter if I asked them a question on Sunday morning at 7 am or Friday night at 9....they were there for me. When they did not know answers to my questions, they would find out and get back to me in a short amount of time.I never felt frustrated dealing with them and never felt that they didn't have my back through the entire process.Our house was in an LLC which was more detailed and made it a bit more difficult in my mind. They never got upset or displayed any negative vibes as more requests were called for by the buyer's attorney as settlement loomed.Dustin was the sales guy and Mariya was the grunt and numbers person making sure every little detail was taken care of.Both displayed the upmost honesty,integrity and professionalism.You never know what you are going to get when you call a real estate agency but I am glad I used the Oldfather Group to sell my property. The strange thing about all this is the house we sold was a vacation home 100 miles away from my home in Baltimore.So hiring a company who you never met with face to face makes it even more important that you can trust and rely on.Knowing they were a Dave Ramsey ELP put my mind at ease that I was in good hands!!!!

When we finally made our choice, Mariya came through like a shinning star.  We had some problems with selling our Pennsylvania home and she was a real trooper in helping us attain our future home and the problems with the mortage.

Mariya Oldfather of the Oldfather Group embodies the attributes on any discerning buyer's wish list! She is professional, informed, responsive, generous, and positive. She acted as our buyer's agent for our new, dream home in Lewes, DE that we closed on in December of 2012.

We had met with  two other realtors before we met Mariya in March of 2012 and we immediately knew that we had found our person. She put in the time to understand us and match us with homes and communities that would be a fit. She helped us negotiate a great deal on a great house and was there for all the bumps and rough patches that go along with buying and building a new home.  

Mariya get things done and suffers no incompetence when it comes to her clients' welfare and the reputation of her business. We believe that she and Dustin did a lot more than we know about because she is consistently self-effacing and focused on her clients' happiness and satisfaction.  As an aside, everyone we met who knew of the Oldfather's had nothing but compliments. They enjoy a well-deserved reputation in the community.

284034,5d420eff-9b4a-4bde-8dcc-10545a1eba63,SELLER,"I am a retired, disabled veteran. In the summer of 2013, I faced significant financial, professional, and personal challenges. At the center of these challenges was the fact that my home was under water and I could not continue making payments. I had previously worked with three other real  estate agents on island (two from major companies and one independent) and could not better my situation. Facing the brink of foreclosure and financial ruin, I called Team Lally on a recommendation from a friend. From that moment forward, I was able to take comfort in the belief that these people would achieve the best possible outcomes for my circumstance. While all Team Lally members went above and beyond to help me, I would like to highlight a few. Adrienne Lally, President/Team Lally – Simply the best real estate professional I have ever worked with. Within 36 hours of first contact, she had personally assessed my home and situation, and developed a cogent, strategic plan for presentation, foreclosure avoidance, and best-pricing. Her knowledge of the Hawaii real estate market is beyond reproach and she repeatedly took the time to answer every question and concern that I had. As a veteran herself, she offered unique insight on my circumstance and developed a rapport I found with no other real estate agent. Most importantly, she maintained consistent contact throughout the process via weekly updates, even after I left the islands. I was never just a number to Adrienne Lally. If I am ever in the market for a home that falls within her sphere of influence, she will be the first person I call. Attilio Leonardi, Vice President/Team Lally – The ultimate protector of client rights. As a homeowner in default, I was susceptible to daily harassment from lending agencies. With a deft touch and relentless application of his knowledge of lender/lendee relationships, Attilio was vital in minimizing the stress of my circumstance while facilitating a no-debt short-sale of my property. Simply stated, if I were a running back, Attilio Leonardi is who I would want blocking for me because a touchdown would be assured. Howard Nett (RA), Listing and Short Sale Manager/Team Lally – Extraordinarily patient and gifted in processing the multitude of correspondence required for short-selling my house. A true heavy-lifter, he was able to anticipate requirements far enough in advance, while using state-of-the-art technology, to ensure deadlines were met and paperwork was comprehensively completed. It’s hard for me to fathom that I was not his only client during this process and his experience in over 600 short-sales showed brilliantly. Howard Nett’s effort was the key determinant in the no-debt sale of my house. Duke Kimhan (R), Property Management Specialist/Partner/Team Lally – The most dedicated and decisive property manager I have ever seen. He treated my property as if it were his own personal property. Initially, he was able to find mature, responsible renters who would respect the property. Next, he expeditiously handled every issue (lost keys, malfunctioning appliances, etc.) to both mine and the tenant’s satisfaction. Finally, using his own creativity and a minimal budget, he repaired and strengthened a broken relationship I had with association responsible for maintenance fees. Duke Kimhan would be my first choice to manage any property I owned. In conclusion, Team Lally’s professionalism, integrity, sense of urgency, and attentiveness to my best interests, far exceeded my expectations and gave me a new lease on life. Team Lally truly exemplifies the team concept, in the same fashion as the New York Yankees or Chicago Bulls teams of the 1990’s. EVERY MEMBER IS AN ALL- STAR and the best at what they do.

Kurt gave us an honest assessment of what we needed to do to get our house ready to sell. He was very knowledgeable about what was necessary and what didn’t need to be done.  Kurt involved us in every step of the process and listened to our concerns and suggestions. 

Kurt’s expertise resulted in a quick sale above listing price. We are so pleased with the entire process and especially with the quality of Kurt’s services.  Our friends were right. Kurt got the job done!

We are starting to feel we have things under control again. You both did such a wonderful job guiding us through the buying/selling process, holding our hand when necessary and being responsive to our needs and questions. From the outset you fulfilled everything you said you would do. You were both available at any time. I don't think we ever had to wait long for a return call. And if you were out of pocket, like at a concert you let us know. That's the attention to detail that has made you first, great people and and secondly extraordinary realtors. On the selling end, you had more showings in a few months than the rest of the realtors together over the three years (I think). We knew within hours how the lookers felt about our home and their interest level. And we never had to call you to find out. Your feedback process worked great. You stayed on top of those most intereseted and again kept us informed. You even negotiated an additional $2000 for the purchase. By the way the buyers love the house. We have visted them twice and they are so thankful for finding our home and always thank us for they way we improved it and kept it up. There were no hidden skeletons in the closet. Your advice, verbal and by email, certainly made a difference. When we ran into a snag, the appraisal, you kept us informed on the status, worked late hours (I noticed the 12:38 AM e-mail you sent to the other realtor) to successfully get the appraisal changed. Your persistence paid off. Our thanks to Lisa for making sure the closings, on both ends, went well. You have a great team. On the buying end you knew our desires and showed us only the homes that fit our hopes, dreams and budget. You spent time with us looking before we even had an offer. This helped us better understand the market for what we were interested in. You guided us through three iterations of the offer without offending the seller and getting us what we wanted at the price we wanted. We are so pleased with our condo. We are finishing the basement and adding the roof over the upper deck. When the construction is over, hopefully mid November, we will invite you over. So once again, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

We were impressed with him from start to finish. From the get-go, we could tell he was interested in doing his job with patience and integrity more than getting the quick buck. 

During the showing process, he was very accommodating with helping us coordinate multiple showings of the same property. He never pushed us to write an offer before we were ready to, but he was quick to tell us that it was a great property that might not be duplicated in the near future. Once we were ready to make an offer, he set pretty clear expectations of what he thought was possible, but was not afraid to be aggressive and work for the price we were trying to hit. 

After the offer was accepted, Luke was attentive and sent clear instructions of the master to-do list and who would be responsible for what. His support staffer, Donna, worked with us on a lot of the smaller logistics throughout the process, and she was equally as professional and competent as Luke. 

Throughout every step (even the champagne toast at closing), Luke was great. He answered his phone, responded to texts and emails, and always met the deadlines he set for various tasks in the process. We were never in the dark on what was going on and he answered every question we posed even when it may have been excessive. There was not one instance where we had any reason to question his competence or his control of the situation.

Luke was great to work with in selling my parents home.

Working with Luke and his team was a great experience. They were always right on top of things, very informative of things we did not understand, and did them with our best interest at heart. The   selling experience happened so fast that it did not seem real, and looking for a new house is always a fun experience. Luke was very patient and willing to work around our schedule in order to look at as many different houses as we wanted. He did a great job of narrowing down the house hunt when we gave him our wish list. When we found our dream home, Luke did a great job negotiating and we ended up purchasing the home for a lot less than what we originally thought. All-in-all I would highly recommend Luke and his team whenever you are ready to either buy or sell your home. You can't go wrong with the Luke Bouman Team.

We were looking for a lot of nice house, for not a lot of money. In a good school district. And we got it. It took time, but no matter how many houses we looked at, he was   always ready to try again. Sometimes, every other day. And I know it wasn't all about money, because there were times we were pretty much sold on a house and he'd tell us why he didn't think it was a good idea. I honestly believe hiring Luke / the Luke Bouman team could save you a lot of wasted time and money. It's been a year since we bought the house, and he still checks up on us. He really does go above and beyond his job. ",Derrick,,,,2013,2013-05-07T06:00:00.000Z,2018-07-30T19:58:50.202Z,RDC,,

We were in an interesting position looking for a home in 2010 and are so thankful to have found Luke.

Then, he explained the home buying process to us as first time buyers in terms that we understood. We never felt confused or lost in the process and any question we ever had was answered clearly and quickly! 

Luke worked hard with our list of needs and actually found a house he SWORE we'd love - even when we weren't so sure at first. We followed his lead and by the time we had walked halfway through, we knew we had our home. Luke knew our needs better than we did!
Luke was a valuable asset in negotiating our home and helped work a deal that was very favorable for all of us. He was honest and frank when preparing our offer, looking out for our costs whild understanding the delicate nature of making an offer on someone's home. He was an excellent facilitator between us and the sellers - striking us a deal that we were all pleased with. 
More than three years later, we are still happy with our home. Our family has grown and the house is perfect for us still!

When purchasing, Luke listened to exactly what we wanted and brought us through homes that we loved.  We actually had a two different homes that we could not choose between   because Luke found exactly what we wanted. The best part of the process what being able to go at your own pace.  They guided us through the process and did not push us into a deal we were not ready for.
On the selling side, Luke offered his best recommended ways of selling the home, but more importantly delivered.  Luke has some great ways of attracting interest in our home, but was also willing to listen when we did not want to use open houses as a method of sale. Luke also provided insight of each potential buyer so we would know how serious they were and what they were looking for.

As out of town investors and parents of 2 Ole Miss students our time was limited when we did come into Oxford.  Getting in a car and riding around all day previewing homes was just not an option for us.  After an initial meeting and a several follow up telephone conversations Martin narrowed our targeted developments and was able to keep us informed by both email and timely telephone calls the minute new condos became available. When we did come in to town, our preview appointments were strategically planned allowing us to concentrate only in the most desirable developments.  We really appreciated his attention to detail and professionalism he has shown when working with us.

My wife and I consider our relationship with Karen has grown beyond professional to a personal friend.  I recommend Karen and Park Co to anyone considering a professional realtor to meet their needs in the greater Fargo/Moorehead area.",John Taggart,,,,,2023-01-20T04:54:46.0000000,2023-03-13T18:23:06.073Z,TT,,

For the last 14 years she's stayed in touch and has answered questions on a regular basis. Having connection to her over more than a decade gave such a personal touch and I grew to think of her as a knowledgable  friend.

When I knew I was going to sell, of course I went back to her and was not disappointed. She is very efficient, kept me well informed, and guided me through the whole process. Because I moved out of state I needed to close from. a distance and Karen made that process seamless. She was also very available whenever I had a question or needed to firm something up.

In selling our Moorhead home, I worked with two other realtors before coming over to Park Co.  Kim Keller is an absolutely outstanding realtor.  I couldn't be more happy with her service.  She took over our listing right after we moved out of our home, so we never met face-to-face.  She was the consummate professional.  Her real estate advice was spot-on to get the home sold, which we needed to do.  Her communication was exceptional, with timely and targeted feedback.  The sale was a little bumpy, and could have fallen apart at a couple of junctures, but Kim and the buyer's agent worked together behind the scenes to be sure that didn't happen.  Less experienced realtors would have failed.  Even though Kim never told me this, I could tell that she was working to do everything she could to close the deal.  That is why you hire a realtor.  Kim Keller is an asset to Park Co., and I thank God that she was on my team for this sale.   She is just what we needed at this time in our lives.  It is the rare realtor who can handle things the way that she did.  

One thing I would suggest to the realty is to consider whether the emails that are sent weekly to the sellers are helpful. There were two I got every Monday--that show some statistics about how your home is performing in the market--like how many showings/viewings/etc.  I found these statistics a bit depressing--and didn't exactly understand what they meant because it didn't really show how other homes were performing at that time.  Eventually, I stopped looking at them because other than how many showings had happened, I couldn't glean much from them.  It seems like there must be a little more to these data--and so maybe you need to add a little description for how to use them.  Not sure--but I bet you could get a little more impact from this potentially nice feature of your marketing program.  ",John Veale,,,,,2018-12-12T16:19:33.0000000,2019-08-05T15:48:13.989Z,TT,,

I think I was most impressed with the ease of selling one house and buying another at one location and taking less than two hours.   I also like the fact that we did not have to hold an open house to sell our home , and almost thirty of your realtors came to our house to see if we were on target with our price.  It just seems your expertise made our move much easier than I thought it could be.

We were residents of California at the time, recently retired and looking to flee California…While surfing real estate sites on the internet, we stumbled across a condo that was near our hotel. Subsequently, we made arrangements through Moe’s office to have a viewing of the condo.

We were extremely impressed with the condo! Two months after our first viewing of the home, we phoned Moe from California and made arrangements to travel to NH for a more intense viewing of the home and a commitment to ourselves make a decision…The process (beginning to end) was not trouble free, but Moe was able to respond to issues quickly and resolve them quickly…We have been in our new (condo) home for more than two years now. We only love it more! [Throughout the process] Moe was a true professional. He made the process as pleasant as it could be and was a great problem solver. ~ Manchester, NH

She was always straight and communicative. Any questions and concerns we had Mary was super responsive to answer.
We couldn't be more pleased with how everything came together. I can honestly say in retrospect with near certainty, that if we were to have anyone else as our agent guiding us through the many dips and turns of selling and buying, we would not be in a home that is absolutely perfect for our family.

It was my sister who found the home we wanted on Zillow. Regardless, Kevin really gave us the peace of mind of helping us get the right house for us. His knowledge of the Buffalo market and years of experience was extremely helpful. This was instrumental in getting our home.  Kevin was readily available to answer our questions and his work with the sellers agent was excellent.

We're thrilled to finally live in Buffalo, in a home we couldn't have imagined, thinking we'd end to buying an older home.

4631564,04ceacd6-e599-45c7-8016-030c2e1af424,,"Nour literally has gone so far above what I expect from a realtor. Nour is a go-getter. He is willing to put in the time and energy to help his buyers. 

In this market houses are sold within 1-3 days of listing. You need someone dependable who is willing to hop on a property immediately. 

Every time I inquired about a property, Nour was there within an hour to view it.

All my experiences with other realtors have paled in comparison to how willing he is to help his buyers. I spent time shopping for properties in Virginia and California before this. No one has provided his level of service. I often had to wait 8-16 hours to view homes. Some other realtors even canceled my viewing if their other customers had higher valued homes (where they would make more money on), and put my viewing off to the next day. 

When the market moves this fast, waiting until the next day will cost you your potential home.

Nour is the guy you need, especially if you aren't there to view the properties in person. I'm from California and purchased a home in Ohio. Someone this reliable is a dream come true and hard to find.

Another important note is that Nour saved me money. I was willing to pay more than what I offered, and he expertly advised me that I did not have to offer this high.

I got the house for $6,000 less than what I expected to pay for it. And he managed to negotiate $2,400 off the price in contingencies.",R L,ryanmlee.rn@gmail.com,,,,2022-04-21T16:08:16.527Z,2022-04-21T16:15:04.622Z,RDC,,

That you were willing to invest time for the long haul was not missed by us. We were also pleased that you had a team to back you up.

That kind of honestly actually enhanced our trust that you wanted to do the best for us. It's not often that one sees that kind of humble demeanor. Furthermore, you were good about giving us information to help us make an informed decision. In the case of the house with the easement issues, you walked a delicate line of not influencing our decision but giving us details and pros and cons so we could make a decision. In the end, we decided to walk away form that house and we're so glad we did. We were able to do that with greater confidence because of the information that you found out for us.

They LISTENED and gave honest, research-based feedback about the market and what we'd be looking for as sellers & buyers.  We were listed over the holiday season and their diligence and marketing plan kept us having showings and interest throughout.   Roni negotiated a great contract for the home we sold and kept things moving smoothly, including quickly arranging for quotes on our repair addendum through her network of contacts.  On the other side of the deal, they've helped us navigate building a new home from start to finish.  Now all this would have already earned a 5 star rating, but here are two extra special things we have to mention.  Firstly, we have a toddler and Roni and her team went above and beyond to make this experience as family friendly as possible, from advice about staging our home with a toddler to trying to arrange showings respectful of our son's schedule.  Finally, Roni and Allison were already impressive in acting on our behalf, but as a global pandemic hit, they quickly and efficiently found ways to continue to communicate with us and with our builder remotely, still making safe in-person visits to make sure construction was moving along.

I had the good fortune to select her to sell my home and property and she performed above and beyond my expectations. Kristin exhibits a great combination of exceptional professionalism and personal, friendly approach and communication. She helped me focus and accomplish the many tasks I had before we were ready to list. For the launch she pulled out all the stops. I felt like mine was the best, most professionally promoted listing in all of Greenville. Her communication was thorough and complete. I never wondered what was going on or hesitated to initiate a conversation. I felt completely comfortable speaking my mind and pushing back knowing that not only would she respect my opinion but would stand her ground when she felt strongly about a position. Kristin leveraged her agency team on occasions to ensure that the best decisions were made on price, promotion and negotiation. A confident, capable pro willing to engage others at key points in the process is a great approach for success. I can without question recommend Kristin as a Real Estate professional for her professionalism, attention to detail, enthusiasm and perseverance. Joe M.

4079981,6814b420-6e1c-48e0-b734-2797c28346e5,,"This will be a longer review, but well worth reading.

Before meeting Michael, our experience looking for a home was a rough one. We looked in 5 total states. In each state, agents were slow to return calls, pushed us hard to buy any home for a quick sale, and in general we felt like a commission check instead of a couple trying to find their new home to be happy in. I'll spare you the details, but a great real estate agent makes all the difference in you finding the right home for YOU.

If this sounds like your experience, or an experience you want to avoid, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND working with Michael Murphy II. Here is what you can expect:

Choice
The main reason to love working with Michael is his sales style. He believes that the best way to help a customer is to play the long game and find them the RIGHT home. While we searched, he often reminded us that a home was missing something on our needs list, or another home would become available and to not rush. He put us at ease, made us feel sane on what is most peoples biggest purchase of their life.

He wanted us HAPPY with our purchase, but also helps you not be a dreamer looking for perfection. He guides you on what you can change, what you can't, and informs you so that you can make the best decision for you and your family.

Honesty & Integrity
He will look over the home you are buying giving you all the details, good AND bad to let you know what to look for, what to expect, and help you understand ways to overcome those obstacles if you CHOOSE to do so.

If you enjoy people that speak plainly, honestly, truthfully, and use those skills to be a guide, Michael is a natural at it. That really can't be understated. We adored working with him and we truly wish everyone had the chance to enjoy their home buying experience as much as we did.

The good news? YOU CAN. Work with Michael. Find a home you love. Do it without pressure. Do it with knowledge and integrity. Many people are good at what they do, but few are great. He is great.

Good luck on finding your future home!",Jake & Michelle,,,,,2021-10-29T16:42:46.0000000,2021-10-29T16:42:49.333Z,TT,,

I am confident that if anyone were to work with Michael, they would appreciate his hard work and would end up in a home they loved. He was very thorough during the home touring process and helped us find both the flaws and the perks in most of the homes we visited. It made me feel like we knew what we would be getting into before we decided if a home was a candidate for an offer. It's a crazy time in the housing market, but Michael was diligent as we made offers which weren't accepted. We discussed how we might approach future offers differently and followed up to see if our offers were competitive. We found a home we loved and Michael was able to negotiate with the seller's agent when the sellers decided they didn't want to do any more showing and wanted best offers the same day we saw the home. We pulled everything together and got our offer submitted in time and it was accepted. It didn't matter what day it was or what time it was, if we needed him, Michael was there and knew what to do.The closing process was a little complicated due to lack of organization by the mortgage lender, but Michael was critical in contacting the company and ensuring that we were able to close before problems arose.

We decided to move forward with Troy.  He came up with some ideas as to what would help the house standout and add a bit of sparkle.  Within 2 weeks he had made the necessary improvements and had the home listed.  The home was under contract within 2 weeks of it being listed.  He communicated thoroughly and always made sure everything was on schedule to move forward. We could not have been more pleased with his service. ,Marcy C,,,,,2022-09-01T06:00:00.000Z,2023-01-20T13:22:24.436Z,RDC,,

His level of experience is astounding.
After we found the house, there was a few weeks before we were able to move in, he kept checking on our house in the meantime/ keeping an eye on it, and helped us work with the builder on some items that came up.

 She guided and supported me through a difficult time and in a volatile market in the sale of a family member’s home, and, after our initial in-person meeting, conducted all business with me as an out-of-state seller.  She was instrumental in preparing the home for sale and reading the market accordingly to result in a much-desired quick sale at a fair and reasonable price.  She guided me through all aspects of the sale, from the initial listing through the close of escrow.  I met with her weekly via Zoom, and throughout this entire process via text, email and phone calls.  She was always available to answer my questions and address any concerns I might have. 

Not only did I have a very positive experience with Dana, but I have truly gained a friend as well!   My only regret is that she is not down here in So Cal.  We could certainly use a realtor with such integrity, knowledge, and compassion.  I highly recommend her!",marilynrule,,,,,2023-02-07T19:00:00.000Z,2024-01-21T20:23:23.384Z,RDC,,

When we moved, we decided to rent for a while and Debbie connected us with the rental portion of Windermere and got us an amazing house. Once we were ready to buy, Debbie's many connections and deep knowledge helped us get a house we never dreamt we could get - and she even connected us with a mortgage provider who got us a rate others couldn't match.

We sold and bought our new home in 30 days. Any time we have question she is there for us and even offered to help move us. Even with the purchase of the new house completed, she is still available for question and suggests. Thank you CJ for a great experience.
