I’m thrilled you’re here. Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.\\n\\nWe have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!\\n\\nMy real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home. My mission is to be your supportive partner throughout your journey, making it as smooth and stress-free as possible.\\n\\nI’ve had the privilege of working with incredible clients, forming friendships, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The toughest part for me is saying goodbye once the transaction is complete, as I miss the daily interactions and connections we’ve built.\\n\\nThank you for considering me as your real estate partner. Let’s embark on this journey together!   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Liz's passion is helping people achieve their goals. She enjoys consulting her clients on their financial goals as well as mentoring new licensees who join the brokerage. In her free time Liz serves on the board with Habitat for Humanity and loves seeing the impact affordable housing has in the community. As a lifelong Alaskan she spends a lot of time with her family exploring our great outdoors hiking, camping, skiing, and biking. On our long summer nights you can find her hanging in her backyard with her kids and working in the garden.    \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Residing in Alaska has been a true joy for Rachel.

I’m thrilled you’re here. Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.\\n\\nWe have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!\\n\\nMy real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home. My mission is to be your supportive partner throughout your journey, making it as smooth and stress-free as possible.\\n\\nI’ve had the privilege of working with incredible clients, forming friendships, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The toughest part for me is saying goodbye once the transaction is complete, as I miss the daily interactions and connections we’ve built.\\n\\nThank you for considering me as your real estate partner.

Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.\\n\\nWe have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!\\n\\nMy real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home. My mission is to be your supportive partner throughout your journey, making it as smooth and stress-free as possible.\\n\\nI’ve had the privilege of working with incredible clients, forming friendships, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The toughest part for me is saying goodbye once the transaction is complete, as I miss the daily interactions and connections we’ve built.\\n\\nThank you for considering me as your real estate partner. Let’s embark on this journey together!   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Liz's passion is helping people achieve their goals. She enjoys consulting her clients on their financial goals as well as mentoring new licensees who join the brokerage. In her free time Liz serves on the board with Habitat for Humanity and loves seeing the impact affordable housing has in the community. As a lifelong Alaskan she spends a lot of time with her family exploring our great outdoors hiking, camping, skiing, and biking. On our long summer nights you can find her hanging in her backyard with her kids and working in the garden.    \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Residing in Alaska has been a true joy for Rachel.

I’m thrilled you’re here. Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.\\n\\nWe have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!\\n\\nMy real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home.

I’m thrilled you’re here. Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.\\n\\nWe have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!\\n\\nMy real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home. My mission is to be your supportive partner throughout your journey, making it as smooth and stress-free as possible.\\n\\nI’ve had the privilege of working with incredible clients, forming friendships, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The toughest part for me is saying goodbye once the transaction is complete, as I miss the daily interactions and connections we’ve built.\\n\\nThank you for considering me as your real estate partner. Let’s embark on this journey together!   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Liz's passion is helping people achieve their goals. She enjoys consulting her clients on their financial goals as well as mentoring new licensees who join the brokerage. In her free time Liz serves on the board with Habitat for Humanity and loves seeing the impact affordable housing has in the community. As a lifelong Alaskan she spends a lot of time with her family exploring our great outdoors hiking, camping, skiing, and biking. On our long summer nights you can find her hanging in her backyard with her kids and working in the garden.    \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Residing in Alaska has been a true joy for Rachel.

I’m thrilled you’re here. Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.\\n\\nIn 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.\\n\\nWe have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!\\n\\nMy real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home. My mission is to be your supportive partner throughout your journey, making it as smooth and stress-free as possible.\\n\\nI’ve had the privilege of working with incredible clients, forming friendships, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The toughest part for me is saying goodbye once the transaction is complete, as I miss the daily interactions and connections we’ve built.\\n\\nThank you for considering me as your real estate partner.
