Nick made finding a house for us as quickly as possible his top priority. Even though he had a 45-minute drive to the area we were moving into, he was immediately responsive to our requests for home tours and promptly answered all questions.

We were impressed with his level of knowledge about construction, building codes, cost and work involved with repairs, etc. My husband has vision issues, so Nick was sure to thoroughly inspect the property as if he were buying the home and then he candidly and matter-of-factly reported the facts of his findings relevant to our decision making, even when that meant we would not want to buy the house because of what was discovered.

After spending one afternoon together looking at houses, Nick had a good handle on what we wanted and what we would not want, and he focused all future efforts toward what he knew we might want.

There was far more demand for housing than there was supply, so many houses were being sold the same day they were listed. When we found a house that we loved, there were already two offers coming in on it. Nick and their associate agent helped convince the Sellers to wait until the next afternoon to make a decision so we could submit our offer. Nick was equipped with an arsenal of tools to use to sweeten the deal and make our offer preferable to the Sellers while protecting the Buyers from bidding too high! His strategies worked in landing the house only $2K above the next highest offer in a bidding war! We purchased a house that we love within 10 days of first meeting with Nick!

He is skilled in respectful negotiations and was attentive to every detail throughout the entire transaction, including providing contact information for utility hookups, even while he and his family were sick.

His standards are the highest and he truly practices customer service, making the process go as smoothly as possible start to finish!

I had the privilege of working with Carol to sell my home and she is absolutely outstanding.  From our initial phone call and first meeting, I knew Carol was precisely the Realtor I hoped to find.  She is a meticulous thinker with a very high level of integrity who genuinely respects and cares about her clients.  Added to Carol's impeccable expertise and experience in real estate and market fluctuations was her keen focus on fairness for both me as the seller and prospective buyers.  It was a privilege to watch her in action.  Her insight was spot-on at every turn. 

Additionally, Carol went above and beyond to help me.  I live out of state and am unable to travel as I used to, so Carol took care of everything that I couldn't do remotely.  She arranged cleaning, painting, minor repairs, and even junk removal.  She coordinated with contractors and connected me with service teams for major repairs, lawn care and appliance replacements.  I could not have gotten the house ready without Carol's selfless assistance. 

Throughout the entire process, Carol kept me apprised of all activities at the house and provided updates on every potential offer.  Her communication skills are exemplary and I always felt well-informed and involved.

My Mom has known him most of her entire life, and she told me i was in the absolute best hands she'd ever trust me to be in on such a huge decision at a young age.  Kevin Burt is a professional, yet personal gentleman who made the process so much easier for me.

Warm, friendly, professional, knowledgeable, experienced, and amazing. That's Kevin. My husband and I were looking for our retirement spot (yippee!) and stumbled across a Fort Payne home listed on the internet. We knew nothing about this area or even the state (we were looking in MO and TN). The agent was on vacation, but he told me he would have a colleague contact me - which Kevin did, within about 10 minutes of me hanging up with Greg. We were at Ruby Falls enjoying some site seeing to try and cheer us up after stiking out in the Chattanooga area and had very little time left for our house hunt. Kevin arranged a time convenient for us, we met at his office, and after meeting with him for a few minutes he drove us to what is now our new home. He gave us an extensive tour of Fort Payne and the surrounding area on the way to - and after looking at - the home. He's a Fort Payne native, and I'm pretty sure he knows everything about the town, it's history, and everyone who lives there. We had no realtor representing us and as a broker, Kevin could legally do only so much. We had never bought a home in AL, so we had to rely solely on the assistance Kevin provided. It was more than enough. Kevin walked us through the entire process, drafted  all the paperwork, and brokered the deal. Within about two weeks, we were the proud owners of our new home. Kevin even walked us through getting the utilities switched over and the process for property taxes (very important stuff) AND offered to help if we needed it since we would be trying to do this from Northern VA and some things need to be done in person. He spent an enormous amount of time with us, explaining everything and helping us to set up what needed to be done for the sale. I am former military and  moved A LOT over my career and dragged my native-Minnesotan husband with me. We have bought and sold several homes over those years. Of all of those transactions, this one was BY FAR the easiest and most pleasant, and Kevin is responsible for that. This was also the most critical home-buying experience for us since we plan to live in this home until health or other circumstances make it too difficult to do so (we're praying for at least 15 years!). We have never lived in one place for over five years. Finding our retirement spot was daunting, to say the least, as I'm sure it is for everyone.

196713,0af2c32f-1208-47bd-b17f-279a8838c539,5.0,"Hello, 
My family and I are from out of state, and we recently relocated to the Northeastern area of the great state of Alabama. 
I worked with Mr. Kevin Burt about 6 years ago, thus the decision on a realtor was an easy one this time around as well.
While some may feel that the process of finding a good realtor, a new home, selling a home, is tough and maybe stressful, I beg to differ. This was in large part, for my family, thanks to Kevin.
He is the kind of person that is genuinely welcoming and right away you instinctively know that you’re in good hands.
He is very professional, clearly enjoys his craft, is great for a laugh and a conversation, and has a firm grasp of how important it is to understand not only the housing market and local interests, but also the ‘people’ side of things.
Kevin collected our ‘wish list’ and went right to work. He was incredibly patient and supportive with our out of state situation as well, keeping in regular contact with my wife and I until our Ohio Home was sold.
Kevin helped us to narrow the search down to two homes, and he made the deal happen with our number one pick ! Kevin helped negotiate a lower price, and even managed to get us into our new home in an incredibly expedited amount of time.
I will always recommend Mr. Kevin Burt to anyone with any real estate needs. 
We have not only found ourselves a great realtor, but most importantly, a great new friend. 
Please consider giving Kevin a shot at your own real estate adventure.

P.S. Be sure to ask him about the story of ‘Wasps - RUN !!’ ... lol

Her enthusiasm and hands-on approach made a complex, nearly overwhelming task seem manageable.

The current issue of AARP magazine says that, whether buying or selling, what you need to look for in an agent is ""a great track record, intimate knowledge of your market and an ability to listen carefully"" plus ""an experienced agent [who] can handle surprises that might crop up"".

I needed a realtor who was knowledgeable & totally trustworthy because I didn’t have the time to concern myself with any of the “ins and outs” of selling my home. After talking to several realtors, I decided to work with Christine Schaefer & The Schaefer Team. She handled everything exactly as she had promised she would with no exceptions! And she did this for me, a severely hearing person, while I was now already living in my new apartment in Liberty Lake, WA. 

Less than 2 months after my home was on the market it was sold for my asking price & recorded.

We bought some ranch land in Patagonia about 20 years ago, and decided to sell it when we moved away from the area about 15 years ago.

We happened to be in AZ earlier this year and thought why not try selling it again? We contacted Jean and she suggested a list price that seemed more than fair to us. We were terrible sellers--we had no idea where our property lines were, or even how exactly to get to it (it was open land surrounded by other land so wasn't as easy as putting it in a GPS). We didn't even know the address lol (had to find it on tax records). We could tell her absolutely nothing about the land (we hadn't even been to it in over 10 years).  We figured it wouldn't sell but there was nothing to lose. A week later, she had an all-cash buyer! She was easy to work with, very helpful and responsive, and our land was closed within a month of initial listing (and it only took that long b/c we misplaced the title from a bank which no longer existed and had achieved our info-- she and the title company figured that one out for us all totally calmly throughout! ).

This can only feel more stressful when your realtor is not on the same page as you, which is not the experience you're going to receive with Julie by your side. We have purchased 2 homes with Julie and sold 1, and in each instance, Julie has been patient, understanding and always on our team. 

What sets Julie apart from other realtors is that she understands the delicate nature and decision-making process that goes on when considering a move; she realizes that when working with a couple, each person plays their own role in the relationship. For example, I prefer to be more hands on and in the weeds, and care more for certain aspects of the process while my husband would prefer to be kept in the loop at a high level and be brought in for the larger components. Julie understood this and really navigated through our individual comfort levels especially for the purchase of our most recent home (which took us over a year to find). 

While no process is perfect, working with Julie makes things a lot easier and more comfortable.

From our initial conversations and meetings Pamela understood what I was looking   for in a property, and, she helped me identify only homes that met my needs.  She was patient in answering my questions about properties that I saw online and, more often than not, was already familiar with and had omitted them because she knew they were not a good match for me, which avoided my having to spend time needlessly; that's the kind of understanding that I needed in a realtor and that's what Pamela offered.  

Her patience and prompt communication to work with me from abroad recently paid off when she helped me close on a house in a neighborhood that I'm excited to start calling home. Since the sale she's been willing to share useful recommendations on contractors, etc. and, again, I'm grateful I was able to rely on her throughout this process.",John C.

She and her husband would always go the extra mile for me and i cant thank them enough because they brought me across the finishing line - a line i thought had become a mirage. Whether it was in deciding what was best for me, or providing convenience features of the 'dumpster', both were there doing the gritty work on the final day in my former home - sweeping the garage or bagging personal items - to make that goal attainable. If i had to do it all over again, id do it with them. A great agent team, to be sure, where experience and sensitivity can turn a bad situation into something golden.

I googled realtors in that area and Sierra‘s profile came up. I decided to give her a call and man am I glad I did. Sierra has been nothing but excellent. I was looking to buy a home for my younger daughter and from the get-go Sierra took over and constantly was sending me information that I needed to make a decision on a property, needless to say we were able to find a home. Everything was so easy and simple Sierra took care of everything. Sierra did such a great job. I decided to try Her again we bought a home for my oldest daughter, and that went even smoother than the first one once again Sierra handle everything from start to finish a true Leader, I must say well everything went so well with the second house We decided to try it again Sierra once again, took over the reins and help us buy our third house we just closed on it. My wife is so happy that she has found her Dreamhouse next to our children. Sierra did all the work again and took care of all the issues that needed to be addressed before finalizing the deal.

We had originally met and discussed the possibility of owning a home a few years back, but we weren’t ready as my husband’s and my careers were shifting.  Towards the end of summer 2022, we spoke again asking for some advice on planning to buy our first ideal home.  We had no idea that this advice turned into a conversation of owning our first home. 

We were clear with what we wanted, then she showed us a few options that we thought were out of our range… but we were wrong.  She then introduced us to her mortgage broker who walked us through everything and answered all our questions.  They both made an outstanding team and showed us it was very possible to buy our first ideal home.

It was a journey viewing different homes, but alas we made the decision to put an offer on our first option that was given to us.  As time had passed, Magdalena and her team went above and beyond, answering all of our questions and addressing our concerns in a timely manner.  Magdalena was also able to negotiate a price for us that made it easier for us to close escrow.  There were times we would call on the spot and she was very quick to respond with a concrete answer.

We had originally met and discussed the possibility of owning a home a few years back, but we weren’t ready as my husband’s and my careers were shifting.  Towards the end of summer 2022, we spoke again asking for some advice on planning to buy our first ideal home.  We had no idea that this advice turned into a conversation of owning our first home. 

We were clear with what we wanted, then she showed us a few options that we thought were out of our range… but we were wrong.  She then introduced us to her mortgage broker who walked us through everything and answered all our questions.  They both made an outstanding team and showed us it was very possible to buy our first ideal home.

It was a journey viewing different homes, but alas we made the decision to put an offer on our first option that was given to us.  As time had passed, Magdalena and her team went above and beyond, answering all of our questions and addressing our concerns in a timely manner.  There were times we would call on the spot and she was very quick to respond with a concrete answer.

This personal attention put our mind at ease as we knew we had might the right choice going with Magdalena Aguilar, Realtor. Even after our purchase, she’s still making sure that we’re taken care of with house services and special home requests/upgrades.  Without a doubt, Magdalena Aguilar is professional, honest and caring and I recommend her without any reservations.

1754704,7d755c2c-703a-44d0-8a77-f0a592640288,5.0,"Let me begin this review by saying Parisa is hands down the best Realtor I have ever met.  If you walk away with only one fact from this review, let that be the one.  The sale of my house is probably the hardest sale Parisa has ever made.  My house needed many repairs and had been badly neglected.   It was also a victim of the Covid virus meaning I was way behind in the payments and VERY close to losing my house and its equity to the Bank.   Parisa was able to get the lender to work with me.  She helped me obtain contractors to do the many repairs that were needed and kept me in check when the process became overwhelming to me.  Regardless of the obstacles that continuously popped up, she always remained calm, professional and positive.  Trust me when I say there were many obstacles.  Parisa was referred to me by my nephew who is her neighbor.  When she showed up at our listing appointment I new nothing more about her than that.  She came to my house, looked it over and gave me a few  options.  I could sell it as-is, sell it to an investor (house flipper) or repair it and sell it.  I chose the later.  She didn't blink an eye and began the process of getting the various contractors, cleaning services. gardeners etc. in contact with me.  She helped negotiate prices when needed and overall kept everything moving forward.  When it was all said and done Parisa kept my house from being foreclosed, helped me get a very fair price and even though it took months to repair, when we did actually list the house with MLS she got me the perfect buyer within a couple weeks.  Parisa expertly handled the negotiating process and held my hand through the entire escrow, explaining everything as we went. Not just the good but she also, when needed, made me understand some harsh realities that most agents would have either ignored or glossed over just to avoid the hard conversations.  Through this whole process Parisa actually became a good and trusted friend, she  treated me the way she would treat a family member.  Parisa has continued to check on me from time to time just to make sure I'm doing ok in my new home. Parisa has my contact information and I give her permission to share with you if have any question as to her character, real estate knowledge or questions about this review.  As I said hands-down the best Realtor I have ever met. !!!",Chan Cook,SELLER,"Mission Viejo, CA",2023,,2023-08-14T14:38:26,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

We started our home search at the end of 2019 and little did we know what was waiting for us around the corner in 2020. We knew this was not going to be easy. Searching for a home during COVID and in one of the hottest markets in the country meant we had an uphill battle. But we felt confident that we had Parisa at the helm charging ahead on our behalf. After finding what we thought was our dream home at the start of 2020 only to learn we were not selected, we were disheartened. Just us though. Not Parisa. She pushed forward and kept the momentum up for us. Seeing this brought new life into our search and the feeling of defeat quickly subsided.

My wife and I are both entrepreneurs running our own business and Parisa worked with our odd schedules. Time is money and Parisa was sure we only saw homes that would fit what we were looking for. Parisa listened to our needs and would screen new listings for us via her personal housing app so we knew anything that came through was already vetted. When we did schedule a showing, she was extremely safe, handled all the paperwork and ensured all the safety protocols were followed. She was very knowledgeable of the various homes tracks we were looking at and was always there to answer any questions we had. Her experience in the industry was also evident when it appeared that she knew all the listing agents personally. We even got word of a few off-market listings from other agents Parisa had worked with. Fast forward 9 months and some 20+ home showings later and we had found the perfect place.

Parisa helped us craft our offer, and even worked directly with the other agent to ensure all our questions and concerns were met. When we finally got the keys, Parisa’s service didn’t stop there. She helped us with amazing referrals for home services and was always there if we needed her with our random questions that would come up.

If you go with Parisa for your next home search, you’ll definitely see why she will become your realtor for life. There simply isn’t anyone better.",Ali,BUYER,"Irvine, CA",2020,,2021-11-05T11:44:09,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

We began our search by interviewing several agents.  It had been 24 years since we last purchased a new home and wanted a home closer to our aging parents.  We were not too excited about leaving a home where we raised our family, but felt it was time to do so.  
In interviewing prospective agents to handle such an important and emotional sale of our home, it was clear to us that Mark was the best choice for us.  Although we received offers at a lower percentage rate from other agents, we felt Mark understood our situation, understood our neighborhood and did not make extravagant promises to us.  He was honest and straight forward and explained what needed to be done to sell our property.  He explained every step of what to expect with showings and offers.  
We agreed that we should find a home prior to listing our home.  After finding a new home with Mark, we did place our home on the market and after following Marks advice on what to do to prepare the home to be shown and for inspections. We received six offers in the first two days of showing, and since he did such a great job of marketing our home, we actually had to start to decline showings.  Mark summarized all of the offers for us, and helped us to make the best decision without pushing us toward any one offer.  We ultimately accepted an offer well above our asking price.  
Mark did not stop his assistance at the acceptance of the contract.  Mark walked us through every step of the process from the signing of the contract, to buyer requests after the inspection, which were very few because we followed Marks advice on prepping for the inspection.  He took the extra time to appear at the inspection, the appraisals for our old home and for our new home on our behalf and walked us through every step of the process right down to the closings on both homes.  
Mark made us feel as though we were his only customers. He always returned phone calls and texts and emails the same day. We never felt neglected or unimportant.  We accidently left an item at our old home and did not notice for two weeks after closing.  When we asked Mark if it was possible to ask the new owner if we could retrieve the item, Mark made the request on our behalf.    
We are pleased to recommend Mark Salas to anyone looking to buy or sell a home. In our opinion, he is a great agent that genuinely cares about his clients.  We will be using him again to help us find a home for our parents closer to our new home.  ",Chris and Lorie,SELLER,"Colorado Springs, CO",2019,,2019-04-15T18:34:20.109Z,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

My home was previously on the market with another agent and it didn't sell after over 40 showings. I was exhausted, discouraged and afraid to list again. Kathi heard my concerns and throughout the whole experience, she aimed to exceed my expectations on timing and sale price.  

Kathi's Spencer's effective marketing and recommendations on the preparation and presentation of the house led to three offers over asking price on opening weekend! She wildly exceeded my expectations of what was possible!
She helped me review all of the offers, weigh pros and cons and figure out which was the best offer to accept. 

I've worked with multiple realtors and by far, Kathi has the best personality. She is an exceptionally kind woman who was really there for my family in this stressful time. We had been through some tough circumstances and Kathi was always compassionate and had an ear and a shoulder for me on top of the real estate transaction work. Kathi always treated me with respect and sincerity. She truly cared and wanted to help my family. This was not merely a transaction with Kathi. She truly wanted to help us and I cannot thank her enough!

I greatly appreciate the fantastic job Kathi did with the sale. I told her the amount I would settle for, thinking we would have to do price reductions to sell and she responded by saying it was her goal to knock it out of the park for me with timing and price! 

Her performance blew me away and she got us well above listing price! It was more than I dreamed was possible with the sale and I am so grateful to Kathi and her top notch team.

After all set and done. My offer was accepted. My wife and I signed the contract and we worked with the sellers regarding their terms. 
The next day,  I get a call from my agent stating that the buyers received a better offer  with no inspections.  In other words the agent wants me to buy a  half a million dollar house and not do an inspection. 
What he did is not fair,  not only for me but every person looking for a home. If a contract was signed and all final offers were in, why did he continue to  receive offers. He gave us the contract and also his word. I guess we can’t trust anything he says.  
A contract and most importantly your word should mean something, but I guess not everyone follows the same rules.  My advice is to not do business with Brian Burke.

I understand how disappointing it can be not to have your offer accepted, especially in such a competitive real estate market. I empathize with the emotions and challenges buyers face during this process.\n\nPlease allow me to clarify that in this instance, my obligation was to represent the seller, adhering strictly to their instructions and acting in their best interest. In a market where multiple offers are more the rule than the exception, each decision is critical and guided by the seller's preferences and the strength of the offers received.\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge that the dynamics of real estate transactions require quick action and the best possible terms right from the outset. While your offer was certainly considered, the delay in revising it allowed for the consideration of other offers, which ultimately led to one that was more aligned with my client's expectations being accepted.\n\nI regret any confusion or premature optimism conveyed to you by your agent. The nature of real estate transactions emphasizes the importance of timely and competitive offers.\n\nI sincerely hope your future endeavors in the housing market are successful and that this experience provides valuable insights for future submissions. Wishing you all the best in your search for a home.\n""}"

It actually made me reconsider selling it, it looked that good! She helped me move to a new town and pointed me toward a location that she knew would be perfect for my lifestyle (no kids yet, worked in the city at the time, and was rarely ever home). So we went for a newer construction with a manageable yard, close to downtown for entertainment and the train for work! Andrea knows all the ins and outs of the process and literally held my hand throughout it all. She helped make the timeline feel comfortable vs. stressful. She's extremely creative and if you have a wishlist that might not be in your budget (don't we all, ha) she actually has an eye for potential and could give you ideas on how to make your dream come true within the houses she is showing.

If you just need a realtor to list your house on MLS with good pictures, then Brian is your man.  After the first offer, I realized I was going to have to do the work to determine counteroffers, receiving only email affirmation and never advice from Brian.  When we finally got a contract on the house 19-days after listing, his 'contract coordinator' began to work with us; good luck communicating with her over something other than e-mail because the only number they have is Brian's cell phone number, and he rarely answered it.  Communication over the entire process was lacking and almost solely took place over e-mail.  I don't know how many times I had to reiterate the same things in those e-mails such as closing date, moving dates, HOA POCs, and driving the deal on communication with the closing attorney.  About three weeks before closing I asked Brian about the appraisal, knowing that was the only contingency I had left on the contract.  After several e-mail exchanges (never over the phone), he assured me the appraisal was complete, only to find out a week and a half later the appraisal was not done; picking up the phone and talking to the buyer's agent would have fixed confusion that was not unclear to me in the original buyer's agent e-mail.  Getting the appraisal done was also frustrating, and would have set us back on the closing date if the buyer's agent had not stepped in to help.  Once the closing attorney and buyer's agent found my phone number, they stopped trying to contact Brian and just worked through me in the final week of the deal; frankly, we all gave up trying to contact Brian.  If I had not had direct contact with the closing attorney and the buyer's agent I would have never seen my closing documents before settlement, the final walk-through would not have occurred on time, and closing would have been delayed.

I reached out to Rukiyat through a website, attracted to her expertise and her claim of working with diverse clients. She reached out to me promptly, excited to help! And working with Rukiyat on finding the perfect rental for me put me at so much ease. On two separate occasions, she took me in her personal car across Baltimore to show me several homes for rent, as well as spent time walking in the neighborhoods to show me the area. Rukiyat took the time to point out where stores and restaurants were, taught me what the environments were like, and kept me on top of how long commutes would be. She knows Baltimore so well, and it was easy to trust her experience and follow her lead. 
I ended up picking the home I am in currently with her suggestion, and it lives up to the expectations she provided. The neighborhood is safe, beautiful, and quiet while still having a thriving community and easy walking access to things I need, which all were things in our first consultation I said I desired.
Not only is she great at her job, she is also kind. She approached me with open arms and no judgement and was excited to get to know me. On one of our viewing days, my friend who had driven me to Baltimore had her shoe sole split from her boot, making walking around difficult. Rukiyat drove us to her home, where she got my friend glue for her shoe, when proceeded to check in with her that it was working to repair the shoe properly and went above and beyond to make sure she was comfortable. She brought us water, snacks, and was ready to stop if we needed anything. After I moved in, she dedicated time to check in with me to make sure any needed repairs happened, as well as answered questions I had about the area. This is all for a RENTAL!

2762500,f54c7103-86f3-4069-8dda-129bc11b1a2e,1.0,"I entered into a contract with Derek Doernbach in January 2025, and from the start, I had concerns. Shortly after signing, I expressed to Derek that I was uncomfortable and wanted to exit the agreement. I even told him before signing that I had a friend willing to buy my property for more, but he subtly steered me away from that opportunity.

Despite trying multiple times to exit the agreement gracefully, including reaching out directly and through the title agency, Derek refused to release me. He began using pressure and intimidation tactics, creating a dynamic that made me feel trapped and manipulated. Because of his continued refusal, I had no choice but to hire a lawyer and pay a $550 retainer simply to try and cancel the contract.

Even with legal involvement, Derek still refused to cooperate. Later, a second buyer, represented by a licensed real estate agent, offered more money and was ready to close, but Derek once again blocked the deal. The only time he agreed to cancel was under self-serving conditions: he demanded I take down my factual online review, withdraw my formal complaint to the Real Estate Commission, and sign a broad non-disparagement agreement, despite the original contract being expired and no legal standing to justify these demands.

I have documentation of all of this: emails, texts, the original contract, cancellation attempts, legal correspondence, and witness testimony from others involved. Derek’s behavior has caused me financial and emotional stress, interfered with multiple legitimate offers, and delayed the sale of my home for months.

This isn’t just a negative experience; it’s a warning. Proceed with extreme caution before doing business with Derek or TCB Properties LLC. The level of manipulation, pressure, and retaliation I’ve experienced is something no seller should have to endure.

I signed what I believed was a cash purchase agreement, with no mortgage contingency, expecting a smooth and direct sale. Derek assured me this deal would close without issue.

When I relisted the home, Derek responded with intimidation tactics and legal threats, despite there being no listing agreement or formal agency relationship between us. Additionally, Derek presented himself as spiritually aligned with me, using language and values that mirrored my own to gain trust.

It was clear that she was only worried about her own interest. She was not only nasty any time something was up for negotiation and I questioned something and was looking out for my own interest but was also unethical . She misled and deceived to complete the transaction. She withheld information, breached confidentiality and crossed boundaries. She claimed a licensed plumber completed work when in fact it be was found to be completed by an unlicensed acquaintance, and she deliberately went out of her way to cover this up amongst other things. She constantly blamed both of the agents involved in the transaction every chance she could behind their backs when in reality, her own actions caused the issue. When my desire was expressed to wait for the work to be done before closing she had a fit & took it upon herself to communicate with my movers under false pretenses. She also blamed the seller for various items which have since been confirmed were not the case, in one instance it was from her lack of client confidentiality and limited ability to control her emotions during a business transaction. It’s unfortunate because my agent did a nice job but his work was overshadowed by her aggressive shady practices.

In the office Thomas from Lee Ann’s team walked us through all the paperwork and throughout the process was there if we had questions or issues.  Thomas even connected us to a person who was able to help us with loading and preparing our move.  Taylor provided fantastic pictures and a great writeup on our home that certainly helped us get the many showings in just a couple days culminating with an offer.  We never realized the importance of things like the photos and listing details.
Once we had an offer Elaine from the Lee Ann team was there at each step getting things ready for closing and helping us with anything we needed.  By the way even the showing scheduling was done very well and kept us informed with as much notice as possible while still getting as many showings as possible. 
Reading this you may get the idea that Lee Ann didn’t do much, that couldn’t be further from the truth.  We received an offer late in the day and that evening Lee Ann, with multiple phone calls negotiated a raise in the offer by $10K.  This negotiation went into the evening and Lee Ann had her team finalize the offer and we had contracts signed and completed that very night.  
The Lee Ann Wilkinson team is simply the best and they are a great bunch of people too!  If you ever have real estate dealings in the beaches of Southern Delaware do yourself a favor and get the Lee Ann Wilkinson team, they do an outstanding job!!!

I could go on and on and ... I will.  LeeAnn was incredibly responsive, especially for an agent as busy as she is.  Every phone call, text and email was responded to in a timely fashion.  I also love data, so I peppered her office with comps about everything and they never seemed bothered.  

When it came down to closing, it was great because they had a full fleet of lenders, repair people, inspectors, painters who all knew they needed to deliver on time because we wanted to close in 30 days.

952731,2602851d-14da-4455-847b-e6aab26b0699,5.0,"After having a long term relationship with Abe Lee, I knew if I ever needed to purchase or sell any real estate in Hawaii, he would handle all of my real estate affairs.  For me, having this type of loyalty to someone comes from years of trusting a person.  The transactions over the years have always gone smoothly.  It was nice to get a property sold and under contract very quickly.  Abe and I worked together to agree on an appropriate listing price.  I felt that my input was a meaningful part of decisions.  He also went beyond what is expected of a listing agent to take care of everything to get the property sold!  I was limited in what I could do since I had already moved to the mainland.  He handled everything and really all I had to do was agree and sign documents.  If anything came up in the transaction, he explained things to me to help me understand.  I'm very grateful for having worked with Abe and for having such a genuine friendship as well as how professional he is in business.  Although I've moved from Hawaii, I still have many contacts there and will always recommend they contact Abe and consult with him before making any real estate decisions.  Having a positive, possibility thinking type of attitude is really important to me and that's an automatic with Abe, a good cheerful attitude!

We had showings and offers as soon as the property was listed and it went really quickly.  

Abe has a very solid character, professional, caring, kind and understanding.  Years ago while working on another transaction, my son suddenly passed from the swine flu.  We were under contract at the time and I had left to the mainland.  It was a difficult time and I'll never forget how helpful and understanding Abe had been and it helped me through my process.  Attitude is everything and Abe's positive attitude and smile is infectious.  I remember taking my licensing classes and some of the students were difficult, interruptive and inappropriate.  Many students would be downright annoyed  but Abe always handled it with grace and respect.","Sharon McFadden, Tampa, FL",SELLER,"Honolulu, HI",,2018-07-20,2018-07-20T15:06:10Z,RS,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

What sets Scott, Tracy and Melyssa apart are that they were fully vested in our successes. They helped us sell our first property in order to help us realize our dream home. When we had small defeats (at the time it felt like the end of the world), they sympathized and hurt with us, but more importantly, they were able to lift us up and give us the motivation and strength to continue towards our dream. We are now proud new owners of the home we never believed we could find. Scott Adams and his team really are the best. If you are looking for a team that goes above and beyond, then look no further.

He and his team took care of upgrades we needed to complete before closing which lifted the burden from us doing the work.

For starters, like most, I don't buy and sell enough homes to understand all of the nuances of the transaction process- and as the laws are constantly changing this landscape, you need someone that knows how to navigate through the motions.  Lucy has this experience, and at the core of this experience shes been able to hone her ability to move through the regulatory, paperwork, and procedural milestones with great ease.  Because shes handled a consist flow of activity, with a very reputable firm, she is extremely talented in understanding her world and being able to explain the motions in great detail.  Its very easy to build trust with someone who can see blind spots before they present problems and who can move quickly through the process.

We were moving from out of state, so we also didn't know what area we wanted to live. We gave Steve all of this information along with our budget and he quickly went above and beyond to really get to know us. From that he gave us his recommendations on what he thought would be the best areas for us. We quickly realized, Steve has great recommendations! After we finally chose an area, Steve again quickly dove in to try and find us the right home. We received emails from him daily with homes just listed on the market. My husband and I are both busy people, so these daily emails were GREAT for us. At the end of the day we could both sit down and decide which ones we liked and didn't like, and go from there. We probably made at least four trips to Chicago to finally find the perfect home, but Steve was always so patient with us. Being first time home buyers we were indecisive about some things and homes were selling very quickly, but Steve was always there to answer any questions we had.

The love she has for her work, especially her clients shines through her dedication and hard work to find every client's dream home.

It always seemed as if she would drop anything and everything to present a showing or answer any silly questions we may have (even if we've asked the same question several times). After having our offer accepted, you would expect that her work would end there, but that was not the case with Monica. Monica continued to check-in and ensure that we continued to receive the guidance and support from everyone we worked with until the final day we signed and received our keys. We would highly recommend Monica to anyone searching for a new home. 
On top of assisting us with our home purchase, Monica also was able to quickly and effficiently find us a tenant for our previous home that we are now leasing. I was hesitant to lease our previous home because of how difficult I felt finding someone would be, but she took all the pressure off of our shoulders and made the process feel like a breeze.

We worked with Grant Collicott of the Forney Group and couldn't have been happier. Although it was our first time buying a home, I have been through the home-buying process with my parents and knew what to expect from a realtor. Grant went above and beyond and blew those expectations out of the water! n nGrant discussed with us what we were looking for in a home and made sure that we saw homes that   were within our budget and checked as many boxes as possible. He was also very open to whether or not the homes we looked at were a good price for the work that had been done to them. Since we weren't sure what a fair price was for some houses, Grant helped guide us so that we were confident in our asking prices and our negotiations. n nHis responsiveness was almost immediate. I think the longest we ever had to wait was 15 minutes. Even if he didn't have an immediate answer, he would respond to let us know that he had received our inquiry and was working on it. n nI think the best thing for us, though, was that he was very   real   about everything.

Jennil listened to us when it came to what we wanted -- price, size, location, etc.  -- unfortunately that had not been the case with many other agents we had met as we looked for a new home.  Jennil knows the whole Carmel area very well and especially The Village.  She knew we would like the house we just purchased and she knew, while it was listed above what we wanted to spend, that she would be able to negotiate the price down to where we wanted it. nWe met some very nice other agents along the way and some did do an OK job at trying to help us.  We'd rate them in the 7 - 8 range on a 10 point scale.  Jennil is a 13 on that 10 point scale -- no one else was close.   nAnyone looking for a home in Carmel and especially The Village, should contact Jennil -- she is fabulous !

We weren't considering ourselves   in the market   yet, but were enjoying our neighborhood and wanted to get a feel for the real estate. Unlike some other realtors we came across while we were visiting open houses, Jennil understood our situation immediately, and never pressured us to think harder about buying a home; instead, having a home pick us. When we did fall in love with a home, Jennil showed us other comps in the area so we could ground ourselves with the idea of making an offer on the one we felt was a good fit. Throughout the buying process, she was there for us 24/7 answering the plethora of questions and concerns we had. In the end, as we sit in this new home, I am sure we made a wonderful decision and we thank Jennil so much for all of her assistance in making that happen. If you're considering buying in The Village of Westclay, Jennil truly is an expert in the area, and makes a great neighbor!

On the buyer side, Bill knew exactly what we wanted as we only looked at about four houses total. The home we loved had multiple offers and due to his negotiation skills, we were still able to get it under asking price, even though another offer was over asking. 

From there, he handled everything from inspections to repair request. In fact, the seller made claim that the home had a new air-conditioning unit, Bill found that error and successfully negotiated a credit for the HVAC system. HUGE WIN!!!

Tammy was not only able to find a home for me that fit my budget and lifestyle, but she helped me secure financing when no one else could. I am so thankful that I met Tammy. She cared about me as a person and not just the commission she would make on the sale. Tammy does not hesitate to point out the unique features of a home as well as potential issues so her buyers can make a more educated decision. Since buying a house is one of the biggest purchases most people will ever make, it is important to hire a realtor that is honest and that you can trust to represent your best interests. I would highly recommend Tammy Bernhardt to anyone who is in the market to sell their current home or purchase a new house.

We worked with Tammy Bernhardt previously in the sale of another home almost 2 years ago in 2018. For the sale of our home in Basehor back in 2018, we went with Tammy Berhardt after interviewing and receiving presentations from Tammy & Matt Jones, as well as, two other Realtor teams from other companies.  One of the teams was even a former colleague with whom I worked--so he and his team probably had an advantage. But after all three Realtor Teams made their presentation on valuation, process, staging, timeline, their availability, and so much more. Tammy Bernhardt and Matt Jones were a clear choice.  They sold our house in the first weekend showing at full asking price. We were on market just 2 or 3 days.  Tammy made my wife comfortable with the process (especially the 100 percent hands on staging, using some of her own staging pieces to compliment ours) and she became a real friend to us. My wife was extremely anxious about selling our home, doing this without me, but with Tammy at the helm, my wife was at ease. I had already started work half way across the country. Today coming back in less than two years and buying another house. Tammy Bernhardt was a natural choice--she is like family. We will not work with any other team because we have just grown to appreciate everything Tammy and Keller Williams has done for us in both home sale in 2018 and home purchase in 2019.

As I researched possible realtors, Matt’s name came up often as someone who was involved in numerous sales and who had excellent reviews. He has certainly lived up to those reviews. We found Matt to be very personable and yet highly professional. We appreciated his experience and the way he pointed out possible problems with houses as well as potential for resale. We felt completely confident in his negotiating skills, and he was always quick to answer questions and follow through on whatever paperwork or information we needed. We went through the whole process of buying a house in the Kansas City area with Matt, right up until the closing day, and then the house we were selling in Oklahoma (the state we were moving from) fell through at the last minute because the people buying our buyers’ house lost their funding. So we weren’t able to purchase the house here. Matt handled it with calm professionalism and helped keep us informed on the housing market here. Once our house in Oklahoma did finally sell, he patiently took us through the shopping process again.

1284178,e892cef7-dab3-4b02-901a-074639d31961,5.0, Raul was excellent!! Before actually deciding to call him we were working with another real estate agent for a while. It was our first time actually working with a real estate agent . So I assumed that it was ok for my former agent to keep cancelling my appointments to view homes and when when we finally decided to put an offer on a house we would have to meet with her 2 days after and with our busy schedule it was very hard so we missed on some houses. Finally I decided to look for someone else. Therefore contacted Raul on a late Saturday and he was able to meet with us on Monday and late time too! I was amaze that we were able to write an offer that same day since we had met late to view houses we didn't finish around almost 9:30 pm but that didn't bother him. Good thing we did since there was another offer turned in that day. Raul did an excellent job in explaining the whole process. Thanks to his hard work we where able to get our dream home.

Suggestions were made as to what we should do to ready the house for showing and assisted in finding workers to do it. She was able to explain the various steps involved during the sale process and explain our options.  Since we had already moved out of the house and were quarantined in an assisted living facility she would text and/or email when there was another step to take,  when house was to be shown by herself or others and the reaction of those to whom it was shown.  Stacey would bring documents to us, try to make arrangements for us to sign virtually if at all possible, pick up documents and deliver to the appropriate source. We were very pleased with her patience, expertise,and stick-to-itness. We made a good choice.  In these difficult times she facilitated the sale as painlessly as possible.

We ended up purchasing late summer, moving in early fall (all of 2016). As first-time home buyers, we were unsure of how everything worked, what questions to ask, where to look, where not to look and everything in between. Jamie took the time to educate us, walk us through the process and take us on the journey of finding our first home. He was patient when we were excited and wanted to see all the houses out there, allowing us to find what we did and didn't like (even though he knew which way we'd lean!). He helped guide us towards the houses he knew we'd love, and steered us away from those he knew were just not right for us.  When we finally found the one, we all knew. When it came time for the craziness of everything that happens after the accepted-offer, Jamie was excellent when it came to communicating, educating and keeping us sane! The process of purchasing our first home was an excellent one and it was definitely due to Jamie's passion for his profession, his care for his clients and his willingness to go above and beyond to help people find the perfect place to call home.

He captured our interest with his breathtaking advertising of this property.  After viewing the video and pictures of this stunning gem, there was no way we could not “see it in person”! The house is a 150 year old, 5000 square foot, brick historic home. It’s nestled into the edge of a major horse farm and the views from almost every window are picturesque. Bob showed us the house on a Monday evening and we made an offer the very next morning.

We were skeptical at first, thinking that Bob could not possibly protect both our interest and the sellers. Oh my, we were wrong. He went over and above any expectations of an agent.  We truly feel that we would not own this beautiful home if we had used any other agent to represent us.  This home was also the seller’s heart home. Bob worked seamlessly with both us and the seller to make this the most amazing house buying experience. We would highly recommend Bob Sophiea to family and friends. If we ever needed to purchase another home, we would only work with Bob Sophiea as our agent. However, we will not need to think about purchasing another home.

Bob has a fresh approach to sales rather than the old fashioned put a sign up and wait. Bob is a go getter and is representational of what a professional broker should be regarding property sales. I cannot say enough about how good an experience using Bob for the sale of the home was. The home was previously listed with a local real estate broker who had it for over a year and nothing. Bod did what the other broker did in less than sixty days and for the same price point that was authorized for the original selling broker.

I have recommended Bob Sophiea to all of my family and friends. My parents recently listed their home with Bob and are also very pleased with the exceptional level of attention and customer service.

Bob Sophiea was very quick to respond to any interest we had on the house from potential buyers/agents. He followed through with every single potential lead on the house no matter what the indicated level of interest was by the buyer initially. He would always make contact with the other agent to see if there was anything we could do to increase the level of interest on our house and he presented those suggestions respectfully.","Lisa Norton, Winchester KY",SELLER,"Winchester, KY",2015,,2015-09-23T22:28:52Z,RS,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

She was never a nuisance, only helpful. When I decided to get information about possibly selling my home of 20 plus years.....I called her!  She has been knowledgeable... consistent... helpful.....understanding....very much a professional. She also listened to what I wanted to do and made a plan. There were no hassles at all, and I work 60 plus hours. She made it very comfortable and easy to do business with her. This was an extremely emotional move and she gave me space for that. Her authenticity, integrity, knowledge in her field, won me over. She was easy to be transparent with, about the sale. Her word was impeccable....when she said she was going to do something she did it! Buying a house is easy, buying a home takes communication and fact-finding.My house sold in 2 days and the closing happened within a few weeks. WOW! She went then another step and help me to find a temporary place for 18 months. I have already ask her to help me with my final move, my last home!!  I trust and respect her work ethic and her character. I will refer her to anyone looking for a residence, as she has earned me as a client and a friend for life. I am a business owner of 30 years plus, and this type of service does not exist in this microwave world! I appreciate and Thank you Rhonda Speaker for not giving up on me!

We had previously used her to find a home a few years back and decided to use her to sell our home in walker when we were in need of a larger home.  She was very responsive with texts and calls and was easy to get in contact with.  She came and photographed our home 2 days after contacting her and brought the paperwork to intent to sell at the same time.  She explained everything thoroughly and had our home on the market the very next day.  We had 4 showings on the first day it was listed and a full price offer the very next day.  She was in contact with us and the potential buyer often through every phase of the process ensuring everything went smoothly w the inspection, financing, and closing process.  She personally came to the closing and congratulated us as well.  Kelly went above and beyond to make sure we had a fast, stress free experience.  She also helped us at the same time find another home that was perfect for our growing family.  We went through 3 contracts before we finally got a home that worked for us.  She was hardworking and dedicated and wasnt deterred by the issues we had with the first 2 homes.  Always available and responsive to every question and problem I had.

I was impressed at the time by Corinne's stress on being an ethical realtor in a fast-paced field. Her name was the first that came to mind when I recently had the opportunity to purchase a home that was/is absolutely perfect for my family. I am very glad that I picked Corinne to be my broker and thank her for putting up with my ongoing (and sometimes misplaced) questions about my new house even now after the purchase is complete. She even returned email messages very promptly while on vacation. Being a first-time homebuyer at age 59, the entire process could be a little intimidating and it was reassuring to have Corinne at my side to help guide me through it. Although I am planning on my recently purchased house to be my 'forever home', I would pick Corinne again if I ever need to purchase another property.    

Absolutely excellent. There is nothing that I would suggest to make any of the above better.

Corinne's assistant/receptionist in the office was extremely friendly and very helpful.

I would never recommend Geri Anderson or the Bob Lucido Realty Group. We entered into an Agreement with the Bob Lucido Group represented by Gerri Anderson on May 25, 2017. We lowered the price to $650K when they took the listing. After stating   with their marketing campaign we will sell your home in 30 days  , they then again asked that we lower our home sale price to $619,900. It was always about lowering the price and flip the house so they absorb their quick $30K commission. When we received an offer to purchase our home for $619K we requested Ms Anderson to provide us with an estimate of net proceeds. Ms. Anderson forward to us in email a net proceeds sheet of $21,278. Based on her net proceeds statement, we agreed to enter into the contract to sell our property for the $619,000.  Approximately one hour prior to settlement we received a call from one of their agents, Wendy Shapiro stating we needed to bring our check book to closing and write a check for $91.30 to close the sale. The buyer had asked if they could move in within 30 days. We jumped through hoops to accommodate and had movers in to move us out the day before settlement. We were now out of our home. Since we had already signed the Contract of Sale, we had no legal choice but to proceed to settlement and pay the $91.30 in spite of the fact that we had just been informed by the Bo Lucido Group that our net proceeds would be $21,278. As a   Real Estate Professional   The Bob Lucido Group had an obligation to correctly advise us in all aspects of the sale of our home from listing up to and including the settlement of our home.

Bob and his designer, Amanda, walked us through our home helping us decide what absolutely had to be updated and prioritizing the more optional changes. The plan put together by Amanda included paint and carpet selections, photos, and lists. It was an invaluable tool to work from throughout that year as we checked off all the boxes. When we were ready to list, home stager Andrea came through for the final tweaking before photography. The brochure of our home was absolutely stunning and the For Sale sign went into the ground.     nBecause of the unique nature of our home with its attached in-law suite/guesthouse, we knew it might take some time to match with a buyer. During the 5 months of listing, showings were steady and plentiful. Bob contacted us every week without fail to keep us updated and in the loop with all that was being done to market our home. When there were questions or issues along the way, the Bob Lucido Team was very responsive and helpful.   nThen came the happy news that we had two offers to choose from!  With the Sold sign now posted, we turned our attention to packing and reserved the Bob Lucido truck for a   pre-move   of boxes before we had movers come for the furniture. We used Bob's recommendations of Perry Moving and Storage, and Maid in Maryland for a thorough detailed house cleaning before settlement. We were extremely pleased with the results from both of those companies.

There were a couple of things that really impressed me that Monti took care himself. First, as the result of the house inspection, for safety reasons the buyer requested to have CSST wiring installed in the house. Monti actually did the wiring himself and arranged for a professional Electrician to have it inspected. Secondly, he took care of all necessary septic inspection requirements from the scheduling to the actual payment for the work. To top things off he was there when the inspection took place and he actually covered the tanks when it was done. One other thing I forgot to mention was the buyer wanted a reverse osmosis system installed in the kitchen. So Monti used his contacts to find a professional installer that charged a fair price and completed the job in a reasonable time to make our settlement date. 
I didn't need to get involved in any of these processes at all. In other words, Monti made the entire house selling experience easy and extremely hassle-free for us.

When we became interested in a property in Ocean City, Maryland, we were very fortunate to have friends who had worked with Carol Proctor twelve years ago. They highly recommended Carol, an award-winning Associate Broker at Berkshire Hathaway.
Carol is a skilled professional who is very familiar with the area since she has lived there for more than twenty years. We were just casually looking online when we noticed a particular listing in Ocean City. If it wasn’t for Carol’s knowledge of the local home sale climate, we would not have acted with any type of urgency. 
We were thinking of waiting until the following week to drive from Pennsylvania to look at the property—Carol suggested that we look at it the very next day. On Sunday, Carol showed us the property and worked with us so that we were able to submit an offer the same day. (We found out the next day (Monday) that our offer had been accepted though other people had shown interest in the property and ours was not the only offer.) Had we not had the advantage of Carol’s experience, we may not have submitted an offer early or attractive enough to close the deal. Carol’s knowledge of the Ocean City area also means that she has had a chance to experience many types of situations over the years. She has been a wealth of information when we have asked for referrals for contractors, local information, etc. Since another question often came up, we have been delighted with Carol’s accessibility both by phone and by text. If she did not have an immediate answer, she would get back to us in a timely fashion. She put us in contact with mortgage and financial professionals who helped us through the settlement process. We are excited to have a delightful home in OCMD, and are thankful for everything Carol Proctor did to make it a reality.

20377,c220e566-13b9-46f5-8bcc-4de7bcbdbcae,5.0,"Shirley Bayer is everything you would want/need in a real estate agent. It’s truly hard to describe how awesome she is to work with. About 7 months ago my husband and I were unsure if we wanted to list our home, if we wanted to buy a house right away or even possibly build. We were all over the place and decided to halt our journey. Shirley was involved at this point and even though she understood that we weren’t sure what we wanted, she still spent the time showing us properties and coming out to our current home for a market analysis just for us to see where we were at. Fast forward to about March of 2022. We contacted Shirley again who instantly picked up where we left off with no hesitation. By this time she knew what my husband and I were looking for as a family. She took us to look at a home and I (in my mind) loved it. However, I was clearly just excited at the thought of buying another home and wasn’t thinking about what our initial wants and needs were as a family. Shirley kindly reminded us of what our goals were and what we truly wanted in a home. She’s not afraid to keep you in check as a buyer and really does look out for your best interest in the long run. Needless to say we passed on that residence because she was totally right and I was just blinded by the excitement.  Again, I was all over the place. So my husband and I went to a builder. This is not a slight at the builder, but Shirley showed up to every meeting and went above and beyond when it came to reading through the contract and pointing out important flaws. I mean she spent hours upon hours reading the contract. Even when she was studying on her own for further education real estate classes. She never fully discouraged our choice to want to build, but again she kept us in check as far as what was important and a smart decision financially for my family. Again, we decided to go in a different direction. So this is the second time that Shirley stuck with us, and kept us on a straight path even when it meant that she wasn’t necessarily getting a deal out of it. Finally we found a home that we loved. Within 9 days we put an offer in on our new home, put our house on the market AND sold our current home. As we all know the market is crazy these days, and there was another offer on our new home. Shirley worked her magic and was able to essentially “sell” our family to the current home owner and that was their ultimate reasoning for choosing our offer. When it comes down to it, Shirley is not afraid to negotiate and go after things to benefit you as a buyer or seller. She is attentive, timely and just overall wonderful in getting the job done. She helped us sell our home and purchase our forever home. We as s family are just so thankful for her. Apologies for the long testimony, but I think it’s important for people to see how she has been there for my family over the course of our home buying and selling journey. And I know some people may say “well that’s their job”, but no. Not everyone is great at their job the way she is. Do yourselves a favor and work with Shirley Bayer.

He even sent us a video of a working septic pump once repaired, which was a welcome relief!

201271,2957812b-f51f-427e-b50d-569a02e500fe,5.0,"A friend referred us to Deb and Jon Meek as we were initiating our search for our new home in Maine. We have been renting in the area for close to 8 months and decided it was time to buy as the market is getting more and more competitive. Deb was extremely friendly and welcoming, as well as forthcoming with all required information. Whenever we saw a house that piqued our interest, we would email or text and Deb would immediately respond. When touring houses, Deb was excellent at pointing out negatives and positives on properties. It was clear to us that she was not just in this for her commission but was genuinely invested in finding us the appropriate home based on what we had told her we were looking for. Once we did find our dream home, she was quick to initiate the offer and to work with the Realtor representing the sellers. It was clear to us that, after 17 years in the business in the Portland area, Deb knew all of the players. With her recommendations, we made an offer on the home which ended up NOT being the highest bid but was accepted by the sellers nonetheless. We came to find out that there was another offer for significantly more but the sellers accepted our offer and actually accepted our offer at a lower price than we had offered. With an escalation clause in place, they easily could have bumped our offer much higher. I can't help but think this accommodation was made based on some of the tips and tricks that Deb suggested. We just closed this past Friday and are elated. During this whole process, Jon was in constant contact and acted as a liaison between us and Deb - guiding us through multiple steps in the process. Now that we are closed on the house, we plan to do some renovations before moving into the house in June. As a benefit, Deb also has an extensive list of contractors that she works with and will be referring to us. All in all, it was a grade A experience working with the TruBrit team. We could not sing their praises any higher. We highly recommend them as your next Real Estate team. Cheers! ",Cindy,SELLER,"South Portland, ME",2020,,2020-04-20T15:46:45.011Z,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

He was very knowledgable about the process and whenever there was a problem he explained all options very well. He does not lead you in a direction but more informs you of all options and let's you decide. He got the most value for my property possible and we had an offer the same day that it was put on the market. 
I would recommend him since he is a straight forward agent. He doesn't lead you or make you feel like you don't know anything or talk down on you. He doesn't put on a poker face to make you wonder what he is really intending to do. His intention the entire time was to get the property sold as quick as possible at a price that I liked and get us to closing without letting the buyers walk away if I didn't want. 
Overall just a great agent. I will be calling him again. ","Ryan Walter. Bad Axe, MI",SELLER,"Royal Oak, MI",2015,,2015-04-29T04:31:07Z,RS,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

Matt was calm during each surprise and worked hard to to problem solve WITH us. 

My partner and I had different priorities for our house and we had a hard time seeing each other's vision. Matt took the time and heard both of us and worked to find something that fir us both. Once we chose our house Matt worked to negotiate and got our first offer accepted! 

As we went through inspections and closing we trusted Matt who had all the connections who offered competitive estimates with unmatched turn around times. It took so much stress off to get the work done by someone he trusted. We are so glad Matt was working with us through the entire process and we can't ant rate him highly enough. We do recommenced him as someone who goes the extra mile, takes his time to get to know you and what you want, and has connections and experience to negotiate and get it done.

We had a lot of time on our hands so we began looking more than a year before we made our offer.  Matt was aware of this, and instead of saying, ""Call me back in a year's time"", he was ready to help us from the beginning.  He listened to our unique desires and worked hard to find that diamond in the rough.  What I especially appreciate about him is that he was generous with his time and he never, not once, made us feel that we were a nuisance. If he was thinking it (because we truly were extremely high maintenance), he never showed it once.  I am the type of person who loves the search.  I find it very enjoyable to do a house-hunting trip seeing 6 houses at a time. And Matt delivered.  We must have seen a hundred homes with him, and that really helped us understand what was available and what we could get for our budget.   When it came to making an offer, he gave us great advice that allowed us to win one with multiple offers.  I remember messaging him into the wee hours of the night, and he would reply back within minutes.  I could feel that he was truly invested in us, that he wanted what was best for us, and that he would do everything he could to get us the very best.  Thank you, Matt!

Matt was an amazing realtor from start to finish.  Not only did we have our childhood home that my mother was selling, but also looking for a quick close on another to buy.  A lot of emotion was invested into the sale of my mother's home and the seamless and quick way Matt took care of it all was perfect.  His attention to detail was on point and we felt our needs were taken care of the entire way.  Not to mention, the amazing video he made of the home - I think is a big factor in which got us to selling within days!
On the flip side, he was also able to secure my mother a new home, in a new city under listing price.  He knew her price point and made sure to secure her the best price with her priorities top of mind.

John worked really hard on selling my home.  He came to Saturday and Sunday showings, for example.  His team is very nimble and responsive, he has a team set up that immediately addresses any concerns or questions.  Any texts are immediately responded to by his team and any contractual documents are immediately updated and forwarded to the client's email.  When my house had a list of repairs asked for by the potential buyer that was over a dozen items long, John knew a handyman who could do all the repairs quickly and at a reasonable price, which greatly expedited the resolution of the buyer concerns and the eventual sale.  Another great thing about John is he saw the potential of the house rather than dismissing any flaws that may hinder selling it.  When there was a botched interior paint job for example, he didn't reject the viability of selling the house but still saw the potential for the sale.  He will try to make sure his clients feel hopeful about the future.. John also tried to make sure to get the optimal amount of money for me, the client, and aggressively worked for my interests. John works hard, is quick, is transparent in all interactions, is firm in making sure his client gets a good deal, and is highly regarded as a scrupulous and ethical agent.  The proof is in the pudding, in that the proof is he got my house sold, even during an environment of high fed reserve interest rates.  I would give him 5 out of 5 stars in all rating categories and would recommend him to friends and family selling homes.  I actually googled John and found he was the number one agent in our city and that's why I asked him to sell my house.

We live in Washington state. Being we do not know the area, Richard check out the house very thoroughly.  Bad and good things.  Helped us hire a inspector. We also had a time with our lender, and he even helped with us them.  Wanted to get some of the minor repairs done and he helped us fine a contractor who is good and reasonable.  Whenever we asked him to do anything he was right on top of things.  Never hesitated always pleasant. I just do not know what we would have done without all his help.  even after we closed, he is still more than willing to help.
If we ever want to buy or sell a home in Mississippi it will be Richard Reynolds we will list or sell with him.  Which we could have him in our area if we buy or sell here.
If there were 10 stars, we would give in 10 stars for each.
Thank You So Much for All You help.

April was recommended by a realtor friend of mine, Ealon Ostegaard, and right from the start she established a relationship of trust. She effectively discussed my hopes and dreams over the phone, and turned them into a reality. Instead of trying to sell me a house quickly, she was forthcoming about their flaws and told me straight up what to expect, critical when neccessary, and offering praise when there was a prize at stake. 

Her respect for the army and her ability to instantly respond at ridiculous times of the day consistently, as well as her comprehensive reviews of both neighborhoods and houses through videos made it easy for me to decide on a place without even being in the state. She is always motivated and excited to work with clients, and if I wasn't happy, she wasn't happy. On at least 3 occassions I really liked a place that she sent me a video for and just before I put down an offer, I decided it just wasn't the right place for me (close to a busy neighborhood, police report concerning, a flip that was overpriced). 

This was no problem at all for April. She tailored the houses that she sent me to my specific taste, which I wasn't even sure about at the start, but developed as I saw more places. Even after finding me some new construction that is ideal for my commute to both an army and civilian hospital I work at, she found me an even cheaper-priced option in the same neighborhood that provides me with .5 acres of land and in an area where I can sleep at night safely. She did this instead if convincing me to buy the pricier option that she could get commission on. She helps with everything, to include advice on house maintanence and help setting up utilities, which was huge as a first-time buyer.

April treats you like a celebrity and genuinely reaches out to check on both her client's progress with house hunting, and also life accomplishments that are unrelated. On the day of closing she embraced me like a long lost friend and offered a graduation smiley face balloon as well as a 100$ gift card for home decor. Wow! You would be lucky to have her as your realtor. ",Brandon,BUYER,"Fayetteville, NC",2025,,2025-05-21T22:44:12,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

As first time home buyers, we were nervous about all of the contracts to sign and new things to learn, but April was very patient and answered all of our many questions, and linked us to the right people to contact when we needed more information.

She was awesome, but when my husband and I found the home we wanted to purchase in Cameron, it was out of her area. Thankfully finding a local realtor was made easy for us because Natalie was showing our home. When I requested to view the property, she was fast to respond and scheduled me same day. Natalie Darling is incredible at what she does. She helped us with all of our offer paperwork that evening, making us one of the first to put an offer in. Her communication throughout the whole process could not have been better. I feel like she truly cares about all her clients.
Natalie called me on Christmas Eve letting us know our offer was accepted and we’d be closing the end of January. Talk about the best Christmas gift! 
With all of the stressful parts of closing, Natalie helped us feel confident and calm as she kept us in the loop about all that was going on. She advocated for us and talked us through everything. 
I couldn’t be more grateful that she ended up being our realtor. She deserves the best. Thank you so much, Natalie!!! ",Nicole and Joshua Cunningham ,BUYER,"Cameron, NC",2023,,2023-02-21T07:18:58,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

The knowledge and experience of this team are unmatched. What is even more impressive, they are good people who live in and are active members of the same community as their customers. This is a people business, and you can't go wrong in choosing this team to help you with your next real estate investment; they will not let you down.
I was lucky enough to work with Natalie, Lauren, and Kaitlin. They, unfortunately, drew the short straw and got stuck working with me. These three ladies were super responsive, knowledgeable, and professional throughout my transaction. Natalie and Lauren assisted me as agents, and Kaitlin was my transaction coordinator and ensured a smooth closing. I highly recommend the Welcome Home Team to everyone and look forward to working with them again for future transactions.
Natalie's performance was superb from start to finish. My wife and I had not purchased a home in over 15 years, and the real estate market was dramatically different since our last home purchase. We didn't know what to expect and were a little nervous. We had a ton of questions, and Natalie was able to answer every  question we threw at her. 
Natalie's cool, calm, and collected demeanor was critical throughout the process. Her composure during stressful points of the transaction was crucial in allowing my wife and me to stay levelheaded and make the best decisions possible. Natalie gave us a detailed explanation whenever something came up during the due diligence period. She provided options for moving forward or negotiating with the seller to keep the transaction on track. Natalie operated like an agent with 10+ years of experience. She has extensive knowledge of Fayetteville and the surrounding area, and was able to recommend other professionals that new homeowners will need as they settle into their new homes.
We can't thank Natalie enough for her work in finding our family next home and we look forward to working with Natalie for future real estate transactions and highly recommend her to anyone looking to buy or sell in the greater Fayetteville area.

The entire process was flawless and the communication between the Welcome Home team and myself was wonderful. They were always willing to answer any questions I had and kept me up to date on everything that was going on.

I had not worked with them before but the reviews I read about them seemed to mostly be positive and they had a pretty high success rate for selling, so I chose them. The initial conversation with the realtor, Lindsey McDonald was very positive and uplifting and gave me a sense that my home would be her focus. Unfortunately, that is pretty much where the positivity ends. I experienced a great deal of miscommunication or no communication. One of the biggest issues I had was the team was ONLY available during 9-5 M-F, this is a big problem for me as I’m sure is the case with most folks I work during those hours. Buyers tend to want to look at homes when they are no working and we experienced several issues with access to lock boxes, miscommunication on schedules which for the first 6 weeks the home was on the market inhibited buyers from being able to see the home. I was supposed to be contacted at least once weekly to discuss strategy, status etc., this was a problem as I didn’t always receive these calls and when I did was given bad or incomplete information. When I shared concerns about this, I was assured it would be taken care of and I would be a priority – there was no change and it actually got worse! One of the benefits of paying a realtor to sell your home is to gain their expertise and assistance through the paperwork. I didn’t get expertise, in most cases I was directing them without any guidance, for that I felt I could have sold the home myself. When we did finally get an offer, they were not skilled in being able to negotiate with an unfamiliar buyer agent. Even the owner, Brian, contacted me during this process and he didn’t even have accurate information when contacting me. They were unsuccessful during the negotiating process and I was the only one who made concessions, compromises etc, which ended up costing me more in the end. The only good thing I will say about this team is that Tiffany Masek, their Closing Coordinator was the most responsive, she did follow up on issues, even though they may have been out of her lane. Unfortunately, she was unable to perform any of the negotiations or work through any issues due to her role. I have sold several homes in the past and I can honestly say, this was the worst experience I have encountered. We were finally able to close on the home, with delays of course, an experience I am thankful to put behind me.

The team was extremely supportive and accommodating for me throughout my PCS to Fort Bragg. I found it very helpful how Brian and Maddie were able to work with me even though I was several states and oceans away at parts of my home-buying experience. They were able to take the things that I wanted in a home and give me a very good list of options. On the 2 days that I was actually able to spend time in the area looking at houses we went on great home showings in many different areas to give me a better sense of what would best fit me. Maddie talked me through the whole process of buying a home and was able to answer my questions in ways that were very easy to understand the somewhat overwhelming process. Once I decided on a home that I liked Brian was very good at advising me on making my offer and subsequent counteroffers. 
Once the seller and I had agreed on a final price and conditions, Sara walked me through everything that I would need to do from that moment until final closing. It felt very easy for me to schedule a home inspection and prepare myself to move into my new home. She kept me up to date on everything as it happened and what I should expect next. Once the results of my inspection came in, Brian called me to go through everything and had a very honest conversation with me about the different aspects of the house that came up in the report. 
Finally, we did the final walk through before closing. Maddie and I took a look at everything that we agreed upon the seller fixing from the Home inspection. I felt so comfortable with signing at the closing because I had such a great team from the Welcome Home Team that gave me all the information that I could need to make informed decisions and ultimately find my new home in Fayetteville. 
Throughout my entire home buying experience I felt well informed and in the best position to make the right choices that are a big deal in any new home buyer’s life. I never once felt like I was just another customer, which has unfortunately been a problem that a lot of my friends have felt in their own experiences. If you’re looking for a more personable home buying process through your realtor then this is the business to go through. If I was to do it all over again, I would still pick up the phone and call the Welcome Home Team to find my next house.

Because of their expertise, connections, and can-do attitudes, we were able to close and move into our beautiful home much sooner than we had hoped. Our agent Michelle got us a showing immediately, and after seeing the home ourselves, we knew there would be offers pouring in. Fortunately, Michelle was confident and we are so glad for following her advice because our offer was accepted as highest and best! Sara Summers quickly took over from there to ensure we knew what to expect each step of the way and kept all the parts moving along flawlessly. She was such a pleasure to work with and incredibly professional. When there appeared to be a small hiccup in the timeline at one point, Sara immediately went out of her way to make it right (even after business hours!) and got our contract back on track. She even hooked us up with an amazingly thorough home inspector called John, owner of Silk Inspections, who came out a couple of extra times after the initial inspection to ensure some work that was needed on the house was done right. To this day, I don't know how Sara was able to accomplish so much in such little time. Sara Summers is a woman you want in your corner!!

Michelle made sure we had the best offer to get the house just a day after we viewed it! Sara moved mountains and went above and beyond to ensure we could close before the holiday weekend and move in before my parents arrived. She was constantly on the phone with the inspector and the people fixing the house to ensure everything was done right and on time. She did not hesitate to make additional phone calls if other parties fell behind schedule.

My husband and I have owned property in Brunswick Plantation for many years. Due to various circumstances, we never moved there and ended up in Arizona. We tried to sell the property two different times to no avail. A couple of months ago, we received a card from Jeff Lott and decided to try this one more time. We agreed on a reasonable price and within a short time Jeff had an an offer for our property. The timing was right and we were happy to proceed with the sale. Jeff has been an absolute pleasure to work with, a great personality, sales experience and competence. Thank you to Jeff for taking care of us. It has been a pleasure, and I would gladly recommend him for anyone needing a great realtor.

We truly can’t say enough amazing things about Karen. Not only is she a close friend, but working with her to sell our home was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. From start to finish, she went above and beyond in every possible way — from her deep market knowledge and sharp negotiation skills to her kindness, patience, and constant communication.

She treated our home sale like it was her own, guiding us through every step with confidence and care. She staged and marketed the house beautifully, helped us make smart decisions, and ultimately got us a fantastic result. We never felt stressed or unsure because we knew we were in the best hands.

I have found most agents more or less just go through the process. Not Karen, she goes above and beyond in every aspect. I have used her both on the buyer and seller side and she is amazing. 
For my search I had extremely particular criteria and she more than delivered. I found the EXACT property I wanted and she was able to negotiate an incredible deal. As I was making this purchase as an investment it was very complicated. This particular property had sat on the market for obvious reasons and had lots of question marks. An extremely detailed home inspection and repair list with estimates needed to be done. She works with an extremely knowledgeable but realistic home inspector. On the seller side she found a photographer to take absolutely incredible photos, got a designer to come help me decorate and make use of every possible space.  She definitely takes a team approach! One of her most impressive moments is when she changed from super realtor to donning work clothes to help with a landscaping issue. I got several full price offers within two weeks. I was elated!
I couldn't be happier with the exceptional service provided by Karen Kimrey throughout my home selling and buying journey. From the moment I reached out to her, she demonstrated a remarkable level of responsiveness, professionalism, and knowledge that truly set her apart.

One of the things that stood out the most was Brie's dedication to ensuring that we got the best possible deal. She negotiated skillfully on our behalf, securing favorable terms and ensuring that all aspects of the transaction were handled efficiently and effectively.

Thanks to Brie's expertise and guidance, we were able to find our dream home much sooner than we anticipated, and we couldn't be happier with the outcome.

It sat for four months, lots of interested buyers, broker open houses, and advertising, but only a lease/option offered.  The agent wasn't a closer, and the house wasn't staged properly   (although I thought it was...boy...was I wrong!).  n nI removed the house from the market, took a deep breath and after interviewing three local professionals with long careers, I found Brie Stephens.   n nBrie came with her team that included a professional stager and photographer.  Two hours later, I saw my house with new eyes and began the work of properly staging it for more appeal.  I did it myself, too, with the detailed instructions from the professional.  Brie approved my work and we agreed on a price for my home.  The photographer then came and shot a video unlike any I've seen, with drone aerial shots and a camera moving through my home as though you were walking through it yourself. The narration was inspiring!  First class all the way.   n nThen the marketing began with notices to all realtors and brokers that my house was   coming   which built some enthusiasm for some buyers.  Once we launched it on MLS, we had an accepted offer that same day for full price...plus furnishings!  Brie handled the negotiations, the paperwork, the communications seamlessly.

A couple of years ago, I was inquiring about the sale of my commercial mixed-use property with Phong, but ended up listing it with a couple of other Agents in the past couple of years with no success and not many showings! Fast forward a few years later, I've reached back out to Phong for assistance and to help me market my property. Phong got right on it with the market analysis to help position the property to where the market is and took many photos and editing those photos prior to posting it onto the market. He is very professional, friendly, respectful & knowledgeable in what he does! He advised and educated me all throughout the transaction and literally got me more showings & verbal offers than the past 2 years combined! Phong was able to secure a very good offer for my property and we had just recently settled! Even prior to settlement, I have already referred Phong out to all of my families & friends and he had already put one of my friend's property up for sale! Century 21 is very lucky to have Phong Lam in the company! I would highly recommend Phong to anyone who is looking to buy or sell a property without any hesitation! Like the saying goes...

I had elected not do a final walkthrough the day before settlement, but Phong had insisted on going regardless and had gone above & beyond to FaceTime me the final walkthrough! During the walkthrough, he encountered water leak all over the heater system & immediately notified the Listing Agent of this incident that we had not encountered before & there were still a bunch of things left inside the house that should be cleaned out. Phong worked it out with the Listing Agent and we pushed back settlement a few days until these issues were resolved. Seller was able to get the Sewer Pipe replaced in a quick amount of time and contractor cleaned out all of the left over things inside the house. I am very grateful that Phong had insisted to go to the final walkthrough in my absence & these issues were caught before it became out problem after settlement.

I thought I couldn't qualify for a mortgage since I already owned a home. But Phong and the mortgage loan officer that he recommended over to me figured out an alternative solution to re-finance my house to purchase the 2nd home. Phong went over and beyond my expectation because my English is very limited and good thing he can speak Cantonese in addition to the many other languages that he knows. So he did a lot of running around working on my re-finance portion of my home and guided me throughout the process from beginning til end. And also working on getting the deal together on the 2nd property as well at the same time. I don't think I would've been able to purchase another house, but he made it possible for me. I am very pleased and thankful to Phong and his Century 21 company for the exceptional service that they have provided for me.

How many agent that you know, can juggle a sale and purchase for a client in a single-day? Not many can say they have accomplish such an achievement, but Phong did exactly that for me today. Today, we completed a closing for a house which Phong had listed for me and we will again meet at the settlement table to seal the deal on a purchase of a duplex which I will be adding to my investment portfolio.
 
It is amazing what we can accomplish together as a team and with today’s technology. Phong was able to help seal the deal on the duplex in less than 24 hours from it being listed while traveling through desert’s dead-zones and using his car 3G hotspot, 3,000 miles away. I submitted my offer from CT to Phong, who was in CA for a deal in PA and my wife was the glue that brought everything together, making sure the deposit was drop off within the requested time-window. It is amazing when you have a truth-worthy team that you know will run for you during anytime of notice and stay in constant communication through the whole process so that you won’t miss any detail.

Our situation wasn’t unheard of, but it wasn’t easy either. With three young kids we had to sell our house and sign on a new house in the span of a few hours- and they did just that. 

For the property we sold, we had offers literally within hours of the first showing- above asking price. For the property we purchased- we got fair market value for a home that will last forever. 

Hopefully I’ll never move again and this is my forever home, but to anyone out there looking for a realtor, look no further.

He first introduced me to the app that helps you do your own research and followed up with me often to make sure he was on the same page.
He was supportive as I put a second offer on the house I wanted. Though our bid was lower and we wanted to re-offer, he took time and explained options of how to make our offer strong without forcing to do it one way and wasn’t pushy or overbearing. I felt like I was in the driver’s seat but that I had a professional as my co-driver.

When it was time to close on the house and getting all the paperwork and details sorted out, he stayed on top of coordinating all the people involved.

We first listed it with a big firm in El Paso, but after almost 12 months it had not sold. We then terminated the contract with that firm, and signed with Kristen. 2 months later we had a contract and the house sold. She held two open houses, and went the extra mile to make sure the house looked great, even it was not her job to do so. You see, we were not living in the house at the time of sale, as we had already moved up north to Colorado. Kristen were extremely helpful with essentially turning on the utilities, and other things, that she felt that would make the house present in the best way. She is extremely helpful, and will help above and beyond what is required of her, and if we ever have an opportunity to list with her again we would do so.

Isabel walked us through every step as we looked for, chose and signed a contract on a home all from another state. She was great about getting us lots of pictures, inspecting the house and using Skype twice to ensure we were getting exactly what we wanted. We are so happy with our house and all that is in it (and NOT in it!).
We love our neighborhood and the surrouding area! Never having been in El Paso, it was very important to me find the right area and a safe neighborhood. Isabel did a great job explaining each area of town and enabling us to make an informed decision on the right neighborhood for us. She also sent us pictures of the neighboring houses and the street were going to be living on.
Can't say enough about what a great decision it was to take a step of faith and purchase instead of rent! Now our money is working for us, instead of paying someone else's mortgage.","Anna Huerta, El Paso TX",BUYER,"El Paso, TX",2015,2015-05-30,2015-08-21T09:08:45Z,RS,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,

I had never bought/owned a home before, and he educated me about the process, explaining and answering questions thoroughly. He was easily accessible by call, text, email, or in person—whatever worked best for me.  nTo get me started, Chris narrowed my search. I never wasted time looking at listings that did not apply to me. He took the time to get to know me and my needs in a home. When listings became available, we were both notified, so when I called to inquire, he knew the exact details of the property and shared with me any extra information he had. He has high standards for the cleanliness and safety of homes, and he did not rest until he got me a QUALITY home that he would feel comfortable living in himself. nWhen it came to making offers on properties, Chris made himself available so it could be written ASAP. He treated me like family and truly cared about the outcome. He was just as concerned and focused as I was so that I didn't miss any opportunities. He shared the outcomes of offers I made ASAP so I was never waiting in anticipation longer than necessary.  nWhen it came to determining a fair price, Chris was never pushy for me to make certain decisions or offer a certain amount. He shared the facts and left the rest up to me. What really impressed me was his research on the property values in my home's area over time, so he had an idea of what was fair value—similar to appraiser research. This helped me so much in determining my offer.  nChris was with me to the end. He reviewed the signing documents and was even with me at the signing table as a support for final questions. Throughout the process, he worked as my advocate, not as a salesman. His expertise and drive for perfection, professionalism, and customer service made him a pleasure to work with.

My husband and I bought a home and sold the same home and both experiences were phenomenal. Chris always kept us in the loop and and if there were any updates good or bad we knew right away. He is always current with the local market statistics. He fights for the best interest of his clients. I have always felt we had all the information we needed to make correct decisions during the selling and buying process. The process itself is very stressful and he always made sure we didn't see or feel the extra stresso...I know he dealt with dealibg with the other agents and people involved. The most important thing is Chris is someone you can rely on and know he will give you more than 100% from start to finish. I hate to sound harsh but if you don't chose to utilize his experience and knowledge it will definitely be a personal loss. Don't take my word for it see him in action for yourself.

The best way I can describe my experience with Chris is it was like having my own personal shopper I felt like I was his only customer and only concern. We all know house hunting can be overwhelming, so many options and areas and not to mention the amount of time it takes. Chris and Christi spent the time to listen to wants and my must haves, they also offered some options I would have never thought of, and tailored a search perfectly saving me a lot of time. When it came time to go look at houses is when Chris's experience really shinned, he was able to tell me about each neighborhood we went including schools, parks, and home comps in the area. When walking through the homes Chris and Christi would inspect the house as if they were purchasing it themselves pointing things out and educating me on things to look for in the future. Now to the hardest part, the paper work, loan docs, title work, legal terms and so on. Chris and Christi took the time to go over every single page to make sure everything was in order, offered to go with me to the lenders office when signing, and did come with me to the title company for signing, I was the only person there with my agent and the title lady was taken back for a second that my agent was with me. Good thing they were with me, the tittle company tried to get an extra 1k out of me at the signing table but Chris made them explain why, by Chris and Christi going through all of my paperwork before hand and knowing the process it was straightened out and no extra money was owed. I've been in my home for a few weeks now, Chris's job is done and I still call him with questions about papers it get in the mail and he's always happy to answer them even once at 8:30pm.

I found Tony on Reddit while I was asking some general questions about high rises in Vegas. He answered all of my questions and went to each of the properties I wanted to view with so we could live stream the viewing while I was still in the UK.

It took a couple of weeks to find a really good property and put in an offer. There was much less paperwork than I had expected and what little there was, I was able to sign online.

Tony produced a lot of statistics and comparisons to help me decide what to offer - more than I was able to get myself via Zillow and Redfin. He was also able to negotiate good terms for seller finance since I didn't have a credit history in the US.

Where we needed third party companies to become involved, for example, for inspections, Tony had good contacts and organised everything. I did my own research on each of his recommendations and they were all competitively priced and had good reviews. We ended up using his recommended inspection company and their service was also top notch.

Even after it was clear the sale was going to close, Tony did everything he could to make the escrow and move-in experiences as smooth as possible. He checked over the title paperwork, picked up on something I might have missed and got it corrected on a Sunday evening. By Tuesday, I had the keys, some cool snaps to remember the day and was ready to spend my first night in my new home!

I would recommend Tony and Kristian to anyone looking to buy or sell property in Vegas. They just made the whole process so easy and were there and on top of everything when I couldn't be. When I come to sell my condo or buy another one, I will definitely work with them again.",James,BUYER,"Las Vegas, NV",2020,,2020-12-06T17:17:18,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

We met Wendy on a bike ride around our community by happenstance. She was accompanying a home inspector on a property under contract. We liked our interaction with her, so we added her to the list of potential realtors to interview prior to making a selection. While we had a well-known realtor living in our community, we wanted to be sure that we selected the right person. When we started the financial pre-approval process, we were given the advice by our mortgage broker friend that you need to feel very comfortable with your selected agent. During the interview, we found Wendy to be very positive, extremely helpful in providing information and did not pressure us in any way to work with her or her company. After the interviews, we were convinced that we could work well together…and she did not let us down!

Wendy guided us on how to stage the home (depersonalize and declutter) and had a very talented and professional photographer take pictures for the MLS Listing. We had several offers within days of list. And were elated beyond belief! You see we had already purchased a home and wanted to sell our property quickly.

Wendy was on top of the escrow process and the home was sold so that we could vacate in accordance with the moving schedule. 

Wendy never sleeps! A call or text was always responded to within a reasonable time. She is very good about focusing on her client and will turn off her phone to give you her undivided attention. 

Bottom line…We were very confident using her and have already recommended her to several of our friends in Las Vegas. We don't think Wendy could have been a better realtor representing us.

Where do you even start with someone as awesome as Wendy (she's GOLDEN).  Our plan was to interview multiple agents as we were relocating from California and knew this was going to be an adventure. Wendy was our first and last interview, we knew right away we'd be in great hands. Our initial plan was to pick homes during the week and drive out for the weekend to see them. Given how hot the market is/was this was going to be difficult as houses were being sold in days. We brainstormed with Wendy and knew our best bet was to have her Facetime open houses with her Ipad while we viewed them from LA. This was our winning formula. A house came on the market on Friday, Wendy took the tour for us on Saturday and our offer was accepted on Monday. The work wasn't done there. She helped us with everything that came after as well, home inspections, putting pressure on the lender when they seemed to drag their feet and so on. We couldn't be any happier with our home, but this truly wouldn't have been possible without Wendy. If you're thinking of going with someone else..just stop..don't. She is truly one of a kind and someone you'll be glad you met.",Casainlv,BUYER,"Henderson, NV",2021,,2022-10-27T15:52:28,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

One thing I really appreciate is her dedication. She works on her out-of-state vacations and is always available via text, phone, and or email. 

I also really appreciate her hard work in getting questions answered. If she happens to not be available to show homes, she finds a teammate to show or handle things in her stead. 

When many other realtors try to low-ball the value of your home for a quick sale or feed you garbage on why a dumpy house is actually a diamond in the rough for an over sale, Wendy is 100% honest and genuine. She doesn't sugar coat things, but is tactful though upfront. Wendy is understanding, honest, and a good person who is always looking out for the best interest of her clients. When things go awry, she does her absolute best to remedy even if it means she will totally lose out in the end. 

There are very few people who are as selfless as Wendy, let alone people who are realtors! Having met and worked with several realtors before I can say Wendy is truly one in a million! She not only cares about real estate, she cares about building and sustaining relationships. I am glad to say she was my realtor for the past 6 months in selling and buying a home.

With difficult and demanding customer like me, she never lost her patience and desire to assist.  The master key that opened the door to her powerful delivery was her honest connection with me. She never pressured me, gave me all the time I needed while knowing that I may never be able to make a decision. This positive and understanding attitude generated my utmost trust in her.  
Jena's knowledge and expertise became apparent each time   she responded to my questions; sometimes I repeated the questions and she always answered clearly without annoyance. 
 One thing that Jena did that seemed out of the box was that she took me to different buildings to show me what else was there besides my focus of interest.  We even walked around the neighborhood.  That was awesome and unexpected.  
What can I say about a person who worked relentlessly even while she got sick from the flu?  Being ill did not stop her.  As the days of the closing approached, she delivered a superb job with her resourcefulness, research, and communication with the management of 
Trump International.  She did all that while being ill.  Her tenacity and ability to deliver such quality work and support is admirable.  I can only express my heartfelt appreciation for Jenna’s dependability.

My whole experience with Jena as a realtor was phenomenal.  Jena loves what she does and it is apparent thru her quality work. I totally appreciate her hard work in planning and executing the purchase of my condominium at Trump International.  She made such a difference in my life that it is impossible to measure. Words fall short, so I will borrow from Shakespeare ""I cannot other answer make, but thanks, and thanks."" She has been wonderful. Thank you.

We weren't in a rush to buy at all. One day I submitted an inquiry for a property on Truila and 10mins later Jillian reached out to me. She understood that we were just exploring options at that point and was willing to assist at our own pace. We only viewed 3 houses before we found our home! 

Jillian was diligent, knowledgeable and personable. The list goes on. As I mentioned to her, she made us feel like we were her only clients during the process. Even when she was out of the office, she made sure that we were still taken care of and on track with our closing timeline. There were never any guessing games. 

Next to picking the right house, selecting the realtor is the most important thing. I will forever recommend Jillian and look forward to working with her for future purchases.

Here is what happened

1. I went to go to this home at exactly 9am right when it opened.
2. Ryan put in an offer at 10am and called the agent letting him know allowing him only till 1pm to accept
3. at 1pm he got a call saying their were multiple offers and to submit highest and best by 8pm
4. Ryan called me and we resubmitted 
5. Ryan then calls other agent. The other agent said why would they accept a VA loan over others they have 20 other showings CONFIRMED by 130pm and why would they accept it.
6. Ryan called and told him that there will be other VA loans with not many clients willing to pay their own closing and the sellers plus their own home warranty.
7. I get a call from Ryan that they wanted me to sign something saying if it didn't appraise i'd pay out of pocket I said no
8 get another call (all this in 30 to 45 min) saying that they would do a 3 way call and let us know, I said i would pull out my contract if they wanted to wait as I knew what they were doing.
9. at 330pm while I was at the doctors with my son that they accepted the offer.
10. I was stoked. I love this house everything I needed without a basement. 
NO OTHER AGENT DID THIS MUCH! Ryan did such an amazing job and didn't stop until it was done. He put me first when we put in the contract and he made me feel like i was his only client! He walked me through everything until the very end. When I moved in he gave me a microwave as a closing gift since the owners took the one they had! such a caring realtor.

Going with Ohio Broker Direct has saved me around $30k in fees. Joan is an excellent negotiator and strategist. Both homes sold quickly and were not negatively effected by going with an alternative direct MLS option. 

You have to be willing to interact with buyer agents when scheduling showings, hire your own photographer (Joan provides contacts to choose from) and possibly host your own open houses.

Dear Joan:

Originally using a full-service broker didn’t work out for us, and then a miracle happened, we found you.  We don’t even know where to begin to espouse our extreme gratitude and thanks for helping us to sell our home, even after the FEDS raised the rates several times.  

Your Platinum Plan more than paid off, due to some unfortunate circumstances you handled because of the lack of knowledge on behalf of our buyer’s agent.  

With your generous guidance, our Open House went flawlessly, and we felt safe and secure.  Little did we know until that evening, our future buyer had walked through our home.   

Your listed “Options” on your website, should also include your qualities: 

Professional
Thorough
Knowledgeable
Kind and Caring, but tough when needed!
Major Stress Reliever
Always Available
Friendly

Since then, we have recommended so many people to you, and will continue to do so every opportunity we get.   You have opened our eyes to the wonders of what your business can offer, especially limiting the stress of selling a home.  

Our deepest gratitude,

Steve and Linda 
Beavercreek, Ohio

With zero experience, we decided to sell our last home without a traditional seller agent and wanted to list the home on the MLS all last minute. Joan gave us all the paperwork we needed and walked us through the process and was extremely responsive. She had us on the MLS that evening with a rush order. We handled the open houses and the ""selling"" of the house. But once the offers started coming in we had no idea where to start, and THIS is where the magic of Joan comes in. She explained to us which were good offers and which weren't, she negotiated with the buyers agents with such authority and confidence that only a person with her experience and personality could. She speaks the language that I didn't even know existed among real estate professionals. She had much more confidence than we did and ultimately negotiated a higher price and excellent terms. We spoke maybe 30 separate times on the night the offers were due and she was 100% attentive to us. We ended up with the right offer and the right buyers and couldn't have been happier with the outcome. Her prices are incredibly affordable. Absolutely buy the full package and pay for all that she has to offer. You're in good hands and ultimately saving from a traditional selling agent relationship anyway. Since then we've referred Joan to others, and we've met several people who know Joan (the title agent, other realtors, and other customers of hers).

While we were initially intimidated by the process as first-time sellers, we had a very positive experience and would highly recommend Ohio Broker Direct. Joan clearly has extensive experience in real estate and we utilized her knowledge during every step of the process. Her communication was great and she quickly responded to our calls and texts. 

Perhaps the greatest benefit of Ohio Broker Direct is the flat fee. We chose the $800 platinum package and were incredibly impressed by the value it provided. Not only did this provide us with all the help we needed, but it is significantly cheaper than the fees of a traditional realtor. In our case, we saved a minimum of $4,000 and our house sold within 24 hours.  

While sellers should expect to do most of the work, this is an outstanding option for people who are comfortable taking their own pictures, willing to handle showings, but want help with paperwork and negotiations. If this describes you, we would not hesitate to recommend Joan and Ohio Broker Direct (especially in a strong seller’s market).

With everything going on during this massive life transition, we honestly just wanted the house sold so that we could move on.

First, Ilyse was adept at working with her very overstressed clients (us) in a way that kept things moving forward. She was patient with us at every step, gently but firmly making suggestions while still respecting our decisions when we might not have agreed on something. She was understanding and reassuring when it was needed and stepped up with assertiveness when that was needed as well....she was able to keep that balance throughout the whole process. 

Second, Ilyse knew what needed to get done to get the house sold at every stage. This included the bigger things like house painting, staging, and negotiations, but also the smaller things, like how and when to reach out to other realtors and potential buyers to give our house the best chance with every tour (or to learn from tour feedback).  When it came to accepting the offer and negotiating the sale, Ilyse was in her element. Overall, it felt great to let go of control and let Ilyse do her job, knowing we were in good hands.

From start to finish, Ilyse was the consummate real estate professional.

She is very approachable, patient and has awesome communication skills! We viewed houses all over Vancouver, Portland and surrounding areas, a few homes with multiple visits. Saying she went above and beyond is an understatement. After inspection indicated possible electrical issues with some recess lights, she bought bulbs and went on her own to the vacant home to test them, which worked! She got us in contact with our mortgage lender, who worked after hours to help get our loan secured. Rosalie doesn’t do “office hours”. She worked late nights and on weekends, too! She scheduled a move in clean and carpet cleaners for us and got us in contact with a renovation contractor that she said she trusted, and he’s great, too!

When we had an offer that was accepted and went through the inspection part, I asked if we could see the house again so I could take a picture to choose new floors, she agreed to meet that day. She also gifts you the extended home warranty. That takes care of the fridge and an HVAC unit if you have one. She is super sweet. Even after we got the keys, and I had questions and concerns, she responded in kind. She has given us contact information for companies to use for things that need to be done in an outside of the house.

In our conversation I learned that she had been an ER nurse also. She had changed careers after a long  successful career as a nurse. She told me that she had been a realtor for the past decade. She told me how exciting her job was and how much she enjoyed it. What she didn't know was that I was planning on selling my house. I did tell her of my plans at the end of her visit and she did give me her card.    n     About a month later I contacted her. She came to my house with statistics and comps for my neighborhood and great suggestions on how to sell my house. She was so persuasive and convincing with out being aggressive or pushy. I knew I had to have her represent me. I knew if there was a house I wanted that she was the one who could get it for me.  I hired her as my realtor. I knew it was a recipe for success. In this crazy sellers market, I really needed someone on their toes and always available. She was exactly that. She never  tried to mislead me or steer me in any direction. She listened to exactly what I said and did everything she could to get me exactly what I wanted. n    When we got into a bidding war with multiple offers,  she advised me exactly what to do.

Ginny brought a level of support and communication almost unheard of these days. We always knew what was going on without having to chase our agents for information. Both were in constant communication to let us know where the market was going and what we could expect. Ginny would even share uplifting quotes or stories from their team meetings just to ensure our spirits stayed high!

Once we prepped the house and completed the paperwork, our home went on the market. The work Ginny and Connor put in was an instant success. Our open house brought in many families and within a few days, it sold!

We're first time buyers and we started house-hunting with great excitement and high hopes that we would quickly find a house that would suit our needs within the budget that we had.

But we weren't ready at the time.

No obstacle would get in her way.
Lacy communicated with us weekly if not daily as to what buyers were looking for and how presentation of our home would accomplish a great sale.
Lacy is the utmost in professionalism, tenacious in getting the job done and she did it.  Our home sold.
I would recommend Lacy Jane Turner to anyone that is looking for a realtor that will be there for YOU as a seller or even a buyer.  We have accomplished  both with Lacy.

We really liked that home but did not move fast enough and someone made an offer the next morning. That did not deter Lacy as she began pulling up more homes and I returned the following weekend and we looked at several and decided to make an offer on the one that we just bought .
Lacy worked hard, diligently looking for the things we needed in the home and the things that we wanted also. I have been able to call her and I get immediate response, she has worked extremely well with the listing agency and she is a true professional at what she does .

Perhaps highest on the list is that she was extremely proactive in looking out for us. By this I mean  we felt that at all times she gave our interests priority.  
 We felt that we were not ""just another client""-  but that we really mattered.  Lacy does not leave you waiting for responses or wondering where she is. Rather she is seriously making things happen on your behalf.  For example- if we called or texted with an issue- her response was almost immediate.
We started working with Lacy to find a home in Tyler  in April 2022. This was a time of a very active housing market in Tyler- with a shortage of homes and high prices. Lacy was able to show us homes at very  short notice to fit in with our schedule- there was never a sense of ""maybe....sometime.""  Rather, we got to view houses to fit our schedule. We appreciated her thoughts on particular homes and her ability to bounce ideas with us.
After around 6 viewings we decided on a particular home in late April. Lacy partnered with our lender 
in processing all documents for the sale. This was so very helpful.
In our particular situation, there were technical problems on the seller's side that were totally beyond our control. This resulted in a serious delay in closing.  In the the midst of this Lacy did everything in her power to move things along. She amazed us with her enthusiasm to make things happen. What an encouragement this was to us! 
We will just say in closing that Lacy is just really pleasant to work with. She is respectful and kind at all times and... she is really fun to be around! I know that hardly sounds ""professional"" from our end- but the reality is that we all need that human touch to share a good laugh somewhere in the process of buying a house.
We are delighted to recommend Lacy to you as your realtor.
Yours

Her knowledge of the area also helped guide us to areas we should look for and let us know of points of interest that would help us along the way.  I would highly recommend Francis Krebs to anyone and will be looking for her when we look to buy another house in the future.  Century 21 Judge Fite Company should be proud to have such a wonderful realtor in their ranks and we look forward to working with her again.  ,"Joshua Gelinas, Weatherford TX",BUYER,"Weatherford, TX",2018,,2018-07-15T10:40:16Z,RS,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

She was a consummate professional, courteous, extremely knowledgeable, always accessible - even after hours! - and clearly worked hard to find us the right property. She was patient with us when we were not finding quite the right home, and then when we did find the perfect place she was able to effectively guide us and use her connections and resources to make sure we got the place on our first offer! In discussions with friends and colleagues they were all astounded that she not only found us a place like the one we ended up in, but that we actually were able to purchase it on our first offer. She always had the right advice and when it was time to move fast made sure it happened, even responding to texts as late as 8 or 9pm to make sure things got done perfectly the first time. 

Trish was someone that I felt was very approachable, that I could always speak honestly to, and always had my best interest in mind.

I would highly recommend Windermere and Trish Englund specifically to anyone looking for property in the Seattle area.

Trish was absolutely excellent in every facet of her work. She is a consummate professional who was always working hard to ensure that we got the best service and found the place of our dreams. She was always available, even after hours, and was able to answer questions quickly and accurately. We were able to get the perfect place for us and all of our friends and colleagues were astounded at how effective and efficient she was in acquiring the property, complaining that they had to spend much more time, effort, and have numerous offers rejected which was contrary to our experience with Trish. We highly commend her and have already recommended her to all our friend and colleagues and will continue to do so.

We bought our house after doing a FaceTime walk thru. House is amazing, everything we wanted.  We made a full cash offer.  On the final walk thru we noted two broken windows. Jackie said she would contact the  sellers and get it handled. So we closed and come to find out she never got the windows fixed. When I contacted her to inquire why the windows were not replaced, she basically told me to bad and the deal is done. It’s only a few hundred dollars but I think it’s pretty unethical to not represent your clients best interest and requests. And not that it’s was required of her but what kind of agent doesn’t deliver the keys to the buyers when they arrive. ",Josh,BUYER,"Pomeroy, OH",2021,,2022-02-17T18:41:41,RDC,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,,

I went to her website filled out a few questions and that same day within just few minutes Jess was reaching out to me asking if we can get together the next day so she can see the house. First time meeting Jess she told me she could have my house sold in a week. I was very skeptical because we had our house listed before for almost a year and never sold. Jess was able to sell my house in 2 days.

Then Jess and Jamie started house hunting for our forever home. They listened to what it was we are looking for. They stayed in communication and also answered every question we had. They didn’t push houses on us, they stayed in our price range. And now we are on our way to our new place. The 411 properties team is like a second family to us now.

Within a few hours, our house was on the market! We were both very impressed with how eager and professional both ladies were.

What I appreciated about listing with 411 Properties, was the large online exposure we immediately received soon as we were live on the market. Within 24 hours, we had around 400 views on Zillow, thousands of views on Facebook, and were listed on several other platforms.

The next day, after only a few showings, we accepted an offer on our home! WITHIN 24 HOURS!

The process was very smooth, communication was prompt, pleasant and detailed. I felt comfortable asking any question I had, and felt as if I had a great team supporting us throughout the process.

Recently, I called on Julie again to help me with anther real estate transaction.  This time to sell my home.  I’m so glad I did.  My home was under contract within a month of listing! A minor problem with the exterior of the home (fading paint on the siding) came up in the inspection.  Julie jumped through hoops to try and help me get the paint issue resolved.  She called around and did a lot of investigative work to get us closer to a solution.  She was able to track down the warranty folks.  Ultimately, we couldn’t make any use of the warranty, but I was so impressed that Julie did all this extra work.  I didn’t ask her to do it. She just mentioned it during one of our ‘update’ phone calls.  The buyers ended up walking away because we just didn’t have enough time to get all the answers on the paint.  But, Julie got us prepared for the next buyer.  And sure enough, the next buyer came along about a week after my house went back on the market. We proposed our solution to the new buyers, and we had no issues.

Real estate transactions have always been tough for me.  I am a very analytical person and real estate has a lot of emotions involved.  Fond memories of the home you are leaving and all the emotions from the other side, all the excitement and expectations is tough to process sometimes.  Julie helped keep me in check so many times.  A question or request would come in, and sometimes I would just take it out of context and get upset.  Julie had a magical way of getting me to calm down before making a stupid decision.  I am very grateful that she has that ability.

Julie will tell you straight, and that’s one of my favorite things about her. You might not like what she has to say (i.e, that your idea of a good price to list your home isn’t realistic, or your offer on a home is way too low, ect), but she will tell you to help you make an informed decision.  I appreciate that she isn’t afraid to give you her honest opinion. 

I HIGHLY recommend her to anyone that may be looking at a real estate transaction.  If you are looking to buy, or to sell, Julie and her team will be able to help you out.  Thank you, Julie! ",Extensive Knowledge,SELLER,"Cody, WY",2018,,2018-10-24 11:20:52 +0000,RDC,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

1961188,46d170b4-3f07-4aa6-b214-cbdfa61e39eb,5.0,"My husband and I planned to move to the Sheridan area after my retirement. We have lived in Fairfield Iowa for 23 years and it was time to move closer to family and enjoy retirement. We met Mandy Koltiska at our daughter's wedding and we were impressed with her knowledge of the area and her understanding of what we were looking for in a house. My husband is disabled and Mandy Koltiska listened to what we needed and really searched the available market for houses to fit our needs. Mandy Koltiska  is also very tech savvy  and enabled us to view the home via Facetime while our daughters walked through the homes. When it came time to sign paperwork it was a breeze to complete the transaction electronically. I can't say enough positive statements about Mandy Koltiska's professional yet personal approach to selling! Mandy Koltiska set us up with contacts at the bank to establish everything that was needed which was a relief since we were so far away!
Working with Mandy Koltiska has been a family affair - Mandy Koltiska helped our daughter and husband find an excellent restaurant to purchase and our another daughter and husband find great home to buy.
Mandy Koltiska is the agent that our whole family will highly recommend when asked!!

Mandy Koltiska is amazing to work with! We never felt ""out of the loop"" while looking at homes or completing the paperwork, even though we were living in Iowa at the time!

I am very impressed with CENTURY  BHJ Realty, Inc. since it is clear that they have the technology tools to assist Mandy Koltiska  to be ""spot on' with any and all research and questions. I also enjoy the videos blogs that Mandy Koltiska posts from time to time - a great way to still feel the connection with the agent.

Since we were living in Iowa during the purchase of our home, Mandy Koltiska was very prompt about responding to questions. Distance and the time change never caused a delay in our communication.

I believe that Mandy Koltiska takes the time to know her clients and deliver the best service possible!","Mary Arnold, Dayton, Wy",BUYER,"Dayton, WY",,2022-03-06,2022-04-23T03:44:50Z,RS,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
