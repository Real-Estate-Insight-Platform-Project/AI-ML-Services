Alaska,AK,2018.0,,agent,"Welcome to my website! I’m thrilled you’re here. Writing about myself isn’t my favorite thing, but here’s a bit about me.

In 2015, my husband and I traded the warmth of Gainesville, Florida for the rugged beauty of Wasilla, Alaska. Go Gators! With our youngest daughter off to college, we were ready for a new adventure, and Alaska has been just that.

We have three daughters and a wonderful grandson who loves visiting us in Alaska. Our four dogs—a loyal English Mastiff, a rescue from the Chinese Meat Festival, a sweet mutt, and our newest addition, a lively Chihuahua—keep our household lively and full of love. We learned the hard way that I’m a “foster failure,” and we couldn’t be happier about it!

My real estate career began here in Alaska, and I’ve cherished every moment. It’s an honor to be trusted by sellers and buyers as they navigate the often thrilling, sometimes daunting, process of selling or buying a home. My mission is to be your supportive partner throughout your journey, making it as smooth and stress-free as possible.

I’ve had the privilege of working with incredible clients, forming friendships, and learning valuable lessons along the way. The toughest part for me is saying goodbye once the transaction is complete, as I miss the daily interactions and connections we’ve built.

Thank you for considering me as your real estate partner. Let’s embark on this journey together!",1,https://www.jackwhite.com/,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/e9a1ce20414684c856954f4e624973edo-c2020343225o.jpg,,,759999698.0,72104,Jack White Real Estate Mat Su,,"99654, 99623, 99645, 99683, 99688, 99652, 99577",Broker Associate,True,3322174,False,,5.0,www.michellecrew.com,5a7bd38ca5b955001010c2e2,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:35:28 GMT",agent,US,Wasilla,865 N Seward Meridian Pkwy Suite 200,,99654,AK,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/fec1e58babac89685390b7376a044f12a-e3977415033s.jpg,False,,Michelle Crew,697969698,#3163e2,,Jack White Real Estate - Broker,https://ap.rdcpix.com/7d759785e937309f2e186e1cf9b71ecdk-c3257626403s.jpg,True,,4845839,9,"seller, buyer",True,1.0,Michelle Crew,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Michelle-Crew_Wasilla_AK_3322174_697969698,,433688402,"Michelle Crew, Broker Associate",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/c3dcbd196b34a6d14f89970136b3b512g-c3216753330s.jpg,Sound Advice for Big Decisions!,True,"My commitment to finding the perfect property that matches your needs and budget, combined with my expert negotiation skills to secure the best possible deal.","I have a comprehensive understanding of the local real estate market, including current trends, property values, and neighborhood dynamics.

Through the years, much of Max’s family resettled in Homer, and Max would visit whenever he could.  He often dreamed that one day he might live here as well.  

After studying geography and film in Colorado and traveling the US and Europe, Max spent more than a decade in brewery and restaurant management in Chicago.  

In 2019, Max decided it was finally time to settle down in Homer to be close to his family and enjoy the most beautiful place he’s ever known.  

Before getting into real estate, Max worked locally in construction management and bookkeeping, learning a great deal about what it takes to build and maintain an  Alaskan dream.  He’s thrilled to be able to help others realize their Alaskan dreams by connecting with those who share a love of this amazing place and exploring the wide array of possibilities this land has to offer.

I immediately dove into sales and that was where I found my love for real estate. I also take part in Property Management Services.

Alaska,AK,0.0,,agent,"â€œKnowledge is Powerâ€� is a phase Scott learned from the first Broker he worked for and it stuck. Scott started his real estate career in Central Oregon at the age of 18. In order to gain his clientsâ€™ confidence and trust, he soon learned he needed to be as knowledgeable as seasoned REATLORSÂ®. He immersed himself in learning market statistics, inventory, and real estate license law. In the winter of 2012, after a successful real estate career in Oregon, Scott sought adventure and change which led him to Alaska. Initially, he worked for a land development company, including managing several new home projects. He was then recruited to be the managing broker of a real estate office, (where he lives), in Eagle River. â€œSuccess is the result of how hard you are willing to work and how much knowledge you haveâ€� â€“ another quote Scott never forgets. He notes it is critical to stay ahead of the trends. Ultimately, home buyers and sellers are impacted by local and national markets. Scott credits his active involvement in the National Association of REALTORSÂ® for giving him an edge in the industry. He learned early on that back to the profession is vitally important to oneâ€™s success. Scott has served on the Anchorage Board of REALTORSÂ® for the past 7 years, both as Director at Large and then as 2017 President. Scott has served on the Executive Board of The Alaska Association of REALTORSÂ® and currently serves as the Alaska representative for REALTORÂ® Political Action Committee (RPAC), Major Investor Council for the National Association of REALTORSÂ®. Throughout his career, Scott has been recognized for his hard work and dedication to his profession. He was featured on the Discovery Channelâ€™s Buying Alaska in 2014. In 2015, he was named 30 Under 30 by REALTORÂ® Magazine and in 2016 he was featured on the cover of Top Agent Magazine . Scott is one of five Alaska REALTORSÂ® who was granted membership in the prestigious Presidentâ€™s Circle by the National Associate of REALTORSÂ®. Presidentâ€™s Circle membership allows him access to their annual conference. In 2017, Scott was awarded REALTORÂ® of the Year by the Anchorage Board of REALTORSÂ®. Scott believes in playing just as hard as he works. He attends quarterly National Associate of REALTORSÂ® conferences which are held around the country. His international travels include: Africa, Central America, Europe, South America, and his favorite vacation hot spot, Aruba, several times. His summer travel plans include another visit to Europe.",0,https://rdpalaska.com/,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/2c778e24969bca2e4b02b64771215cfco-b2274465705s.jpg,,,,92598,RE MAX Dynamic Properties,,"99577, 99567, 99654, 99645, 99623, 99501, 99503, 99515",true,True,3291572,False,,0.0,http://www.myeagleriver.net,5a50127c19c58c0010fa18f1,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:54:58 GMT",agent,US,Eagle River,11525 Old Glenn Hwy,,99577,AK,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1dfb1db45d48f83632e4f360305af47da-e2753845738s.jpg,False,,Scott Myers,486189998,,,RE/MAX Dynamic Properties -  Broker,,,,4172446,0,"buyer, seller",True,4.0,Scott Myers,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Scott-Myers_Eagle-River_AK_3291572_486189998,,43740396,"Scott Myers, true",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/404887628/a056a456f8824b33c37a58e029cc5244g-c0s.jpg,Setting The Standard In Real Estate,False,,,2025-09-15T17:52:31Z,33000,850000,17,0,0,2025-10-08,74,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anchorage_AK, Eagle River_AK, Chugiak_AK, Knik-Fairview_AK, North Lakes_AK, Meadow Lakes_AK, Wasilla_AK, Fishhook_AK, Tanaina_AK, South Lakes_AK, Lakes_AK, Gateway_AK, Farm Loop_AK, Butte_AK, Buffalo Soapstone_AK, Lazy Mountain_AK, Knik River_AK, Sutton-Alpine_AK, Palmer_AK, Willow_AK, Point MacKenzie_AK, Meadow Lake_AK, Houston_AK, Susitna_AK, Big Lake_AK","Eagle River_AK, Chugiak_AK, Wasilla_AK, Palmer_AK, Anchorage_AK","New Construction, Re-Sale, Land, Lodges, Remote Properties, Relocation, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_19911990,,"FAR_19911990, FAR_202E1E4D",,FAR_19911990,,"FAR_19911990, FAR_202E1E4D",,,,,"11525 Old Glenn Hwy, <NA>, Eagle River, AK 99577, US",(907) 694-4200,Office,"(907) 694-4200 (Office), (907) 302-4583 (Fax)",,,(907) 280-8010,Mobile,(907) 280-8010,"(907) 280-8010 (Office), (907) 280-8010 (Mobile)"

Alabama,AL,2024.0,,agent,"Originally from St. Louis, Missouri, I relocated to Baldwin County, Alabama, in 2017 after my youngest daughter’s marriage officially made me an empty nester. Drawn to the area’s charm and coastal lifestyle, the move felt like a natural next chapter in my life journey filled with family, adventure, and new beginnings.

I first discovered the beauty of the area in 2005 while visiting friends in Bay Minette, AL who had recently relocated. To my surprise, I learned that Alabama boasts stunning beaches just a short drive south! Who knew, right? From that very first visit, the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the surrounding area became a favorite destination, with my family vacationing here multiple times a year. Over the years, my love for the region only grew, making Baldwin County the perfect place to call home.

My deep connection to this community and its unique lifestyle inspires me daily to share all the area has to offer. I bring extensive experience and a passion for helping others to everything I do.

With over 25 years in the bridal industry, I’ve had the privilege of guiding families through some of life’s most memorable moments. From the initial consultation to managing countless details, I’ve ensured that every event came together seamlessly.

In addition to my time in the bridal world, I’ve spent 10 years in hospitality and tourism, where I learned the value of exceptional service and building lasting relationships. I’ve also worked as a Client Services and Business Development Manager in the legal field (where I won my first Island Spirit Award in 2021), honing my skills in trust-building, strategic planning, and problem-solving.

Now, I’m thrilled to bring this wealth of experience to real estate as a proud member of the LEAD Realty Group team. Buying or selling a home is a big milestone, and my goal is to make the process smooth and stress-free. I focus on understanding your needs, paying attention to every detail, and ensuring you feel confident at every step.

Whether you’re searching for your dream home or preparing to sell, you deserve a dedicated, approachable partner who’s ready to go the extra mile. That’s me!

Arkansas,AR,2016.0,,agent,"Meet Pamela Welch – Broker/Owner of Mossy Oak Properties Selling Arkansas
Hello, I’m Pamela Welch, Broker/Owner of Mossy Oak Properties Selling Arkansas, and I’m passionate about helping people achieve their dreams of buying and selling property. I was born and raised in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and now reside with my family in Cave City, where my husband, Arlon Welch, and I have built a life and business rooted in integrity, hard work, and a shared love for the outdoors.

I’m married to my best friend, Arlon Welch, who is also a Mossy Oak Properties Realtor. Together, we’ve raised three incredible children:

Our twin daughters, now 29, both having families of their own.
Our son Brayden, 24, also having a family of his own and works with his wife, Robin with both being a part of the Mossy Oak Properties team.
Family is everything to us, and working together to help others find the perfect property is a dream come true.

A Legacy of Selling

My passion for selling began at my grandparents’ furniture store in Jonesboro, where I spent countless hours as a child learning how to buy, sell, and trade alongside my grandfather. Those early lessons shaped my career and instilled a love for connecting people with the things they need and value.

Over the years, I’ve expanded my experience to include farming, real estate, and land management. Growing up helping on my grandparents’ farm in Imboden, Arkansas, gave me a love for hard work and a deep appreciation for the land. As an adult, I drove a tractor alongside my husband, farming as much as 6,500 acres of row crops, and now we operate a cattle farm while managing various other ventures, including commercial offices and rental properties.

Specializing in Poultry Farms and Agricultural Properties

In 2015, Arlon and I built 8 OMP Broiler houses, which we sold in 2017. This experience gave me in-depth knowledge of poultry farming, and since then, I’ve specialized in buying and selling poultry farms. Whether it’s poultry, farmland, duck holes, or timberland, I understand the unique aspects of these transactions and have the expertise to guide my clients through them seamlessly.

The Mossy Oak Journey

In March 2017, Arlon and I took a significant leap by purchasing a Mossy Oak Properties Franchise and relocating it to Cave City. That December, I earned my Broker License, becoming the Broker/Owner of our office. Today, I’m proud to lead a talented team of professionals who share my dedication to excellence and client success.

Why Choose Me?

Every client and every property matters deeply to me. I am committed to walking with you every step of the way, from the first conversation to the final closing. Buying or selling a property is one of the biggest decisions you’ll ever make, and I am here to make it as smooth and successful as possible.

With my extensive experience, hardworking team, and love for what I do, you’ll have the full support of Mossy Oak Properties Selling Arkansas behind you. Whether you’re looking to buy a farm, sell your property, or invest in your future, I’ll work tirelessly to ensure your goals are met.

Despite higher interest rates, buyer interest remains strong, particularly among those looking for mid-range homes. Homes are selling quickly, often receiving multiple offers within days of listing. There’s also a growing interest in energy-efficient and eco-friendly homes, as buyers become more conscious of sustainability. However, the market is starting to show signs of balancing, with slightly longer days on market and more price reductions compared to last year. This could indicate a shift towards a more stabilized market in the coming months.","Online Marketing Strategy:

- High-Quality Visual Content: Professional HD photos, videos, and aerial footage will be produced to make your property stand out online.
- Virtual Experience: A virtual tour and walk-through video will be created, allowing buyers to explore your home from anywhere.
- Custom Property Website: A dedicated interactive website will be built for your home, showcasing its features, HD photos, maps, community highlights, and school information.
- Social Media Campaign: Your property will be promoted on social media through both free and paid ads, including placement on my professional Facebook page.
- Email Marketing: A detailed flyer highlighting your home’s features and upgrades will be emailed to the top 100 agents in the marketplace.

Offline Marketing Strategy:

Targeted Direct Mail: Postcards will be sent to 50-100 of your neighbors, notifying them that your property is for sale.
- Agent Networking: I will personally notify the 900+ agents in my office and top agents across Tucson about your listing.
- Open Houses and Events: I’ll organize open houses or social events to attract buyers, with personal invitations sent to your neighbors.

Arizona,AZ,2021.0,,agent,"If you are looking for a REALTOR® who is committed to you and will guide you through the process of buying or selling a home then you have found your agent.  My name is Mark Gathmann and I am dedicated, knowledgeable, transparent, and most importantly devoted to making your real estate experience a pleasant one.

I was born and raised in Indiana and attended Indiana University where I got my BS in Secondary Education.  My college career gave me a unique opportunity to teach on the Navajo Indian Reservation in Northeastern Arizona.  I spent nine years teaching and acting as the district’s athletic director before deciding to call Tucson home.  During my time on the Reservation, I also earned my MS in Coaching and Athletic Administration. I wore many hats as part of the school administration team that has developed me into the REALTOR I am today. These roles instilled in me tenacity, problem solving skills, and compassion.

I discovered my passion for real estate when my wife and I made the decision to call Tucson home. Until I made my passion become my reality, I taught World History at Flowing Wells High School for five years.  Although teaching was a fulfilling and humbling career, I began spending my days reading, observing, discussing, debating, and negotiating real estate. Making a career change is not easy, but I believe life is too short not to be living out your passion; and while education served that purpose for many years, sometimes passions change.

Teaching and real estate have one thing in common, it’s a 24/7 endeavor. Yet it’s important to find time to fill your cup- I’m an avid sports fan, I love the outdoors, I take pleasure in improving our own home inside and out, and I love traveling with my wife. I do find time for myself, but my time is truly dedicated for you.  My endless loyalty to you as client(s) will be my most critical characteristic.  I am relentless, passionate, and enthusiastic about real estate. I am always thinking of your best interest in all my decisions. I look forward to working alongside you to make your real estate dreams a reality.

Arizona,AZ,2015.0,English,agent,"Trusted Guidance

Welcome to Tucson! Searching for a new home or investment can be daunting, especially when demand is high and inventory is low. I've lived here my entire life, and know this unique, explosive real estate market better than most. My experience and unwavering work ethic are the reason I can confidently say I will find what you are looking for — whether it's your permanent or secondary residence, a 1031 exchange, or premium land for the foundation of your dream home.


I'm a proud graduate of the University of Arizona (B.A., Marketing). But, it's my real-life experience across technology, mass media and real estate industries — in marketing, sales, business development, and strategic planning and execution that has built my foundation.  I'm an out-of-the-box thinker, problem solver and client advocate with exceptional interpersonal and negotiation skills you will benefit from. That I promise. And, while no home buying experience is stress free, my consultative and highly confidential guidance will be with you every step of the way to (or from) Tucson.

California,CA,2021.0,,agent,"Hi, I'm Sierra Haskins!

I'm the owner of The NorCal Life Real Estate Group, along with my husband, Andrew Haskins. We are a dynamic partnership with diverse backgrounds, united by a common passion—serving our client's real estate needs with excellence and integrity. Our team currently serves the Butte County and Yuba County areas covering cities like Paradise, Chico, Oroville, Yuba City and More.
I lived in the Yuba City area for almost 20 years and he is a native of the Paradise/Magalia area. We’ve since made our home in Chico, but between both of us living long term in every area we serve, we are intimately familiar with both Butte and Yuba /Sutter Counties, making our knowledge of the area a huge asset to our clients. In addition to dedicating ourselves to the local families we work with, we have a profound respect and gratitude for the military and those who serve our greater Nation. Being the daughter of two Army Vets and parents to four remarkable sons, three of whom have answered the call of duty, our lives are intimately woven with military experience and knowledge.  So in addition to passionately serving the families who currently live in the Butte County and Yuba/Sutter area, I also understand the unique challenges military families encounter and our team is well connected across the Nation to help ensure a seamless, supportive real estate journey for them as well.

Before joining the world of real estate, Andrew dedicated over a decade to service as a police officer with most of that time spent in Butte County, embodying the meaning of service and community. His transition into real estate was a natural progression, adding a unique layer of integrity, insight, and attention to detail to our business.

Our collective experience arms us with the versatility to navigate various transaction types, from helping first-time homebuyers, managing the difficulties of distressed properties, the sensitivities of probate transactions, and the unique challenges of military families who are PCSing.

2. YOUR HOME WILL SELL FOR 18,045 DOLLARS MORE     
We sell our clients homes for an average of 4.01 percent more money compared to the average area agent. On a 450,000 dollar home, that's an extra 18,045 dollars more money in your pocket.

3. YOUR HOME WILL SELL 2 TIMES FASTER  
We sell our clients homes on average in only 23 days while the average area agent sells theirs in 34 days.

4. YOUR HOME IS MORE LIKELY TO SELL  
Not only do we sell our clients homes for more money and faster than average area agent, your home is more likely to sell.

Colorado,CO,2014.0,,agent,"“I love helping people achieve the American Dream of home ownership.  Knowing families will make lasting memories in these homes and knowing that I’m a small part of that is extremely rewarding.” 
 
Alex Reber grew up in Cherry Hill, NJ.  He spent his childhood playing baseball, going to sleep away camp (where he picked up his favorite party trick - juggling) and traveling west on ski vacations with his family.
 
It was inevitable that the ski vacations would lead Alex to the University of Denver. During his senior year, Alex enrolled in an Introduction to Real Estate course, where he discovered his passion for the industry. In 2010 he graduated with a degree in Communications with dual minors in Business and Sociology. A self-motivator, Alex continued his education and obtained his Real Estate license. Through his innate ability to network and bring people together, he began to build his business under the guidance of Madison & Company.  His clients admire his incredible work ethic (something he credits to his Dad) and appreciate his authentic desire to help them navigate the home buying and selling processes.
 
“I cannot speak highly enough of Alex. We first met him 3 years ago when we bought our house from him and we used him again this year to sell it. From day one he was polite, professional, responsive and knowledgeable. When it came to selling the house we were completely guided by his  recommendations, which he explained in detail to us, and as a result we sold our house on the first weekend it went on the market for the price that we wanted. First class service! Thanks, Alex”
                    	- Sally B. Bought and sold homes in 2019 in Littleton, CO.
 
In addition to devoting unlimited time to his clients, Alex is constantly seeking to expand his community footprint and support causes near and dear to him.  As an avid runner, he’s excited to be involved with ‘Back on my Feet’ - a national organization that uses running, and running clubs, to motivate, support and empower the homeless populations in 13 major cities, including Denver. 
 
When not working, running, or spending time with his black Lab, Dylan, Alex can be found hitting the links with his friends or taking a few runs at Beaver Creek - and sometimes all in the same day!  Another personal passion is travel. In recent years, he has revisited Australia, where he had spent a college semester abroad, he has attended the FIFA World Cup games in South America and in 2019, using his Epic Pass, he skied in Japan.
 
As a multiple Golden Key Award recipient, an accolade reserved for Madison & Company’s top sales producers of over 10 million annually, Alex continuously strives to be the best Realtor in Denver.  If you are looking to learn more about the market or buy or sell your home, you will find both a realtor and a friend in Alex Reber.  He looks forward to meeting you and helping you, too, achieve your real estate dreams.",0,http://www.madisonprops.com/,,,,,,1386601,MADISON AND COMPANY PROPERTIES,,80204,Broker Associate,True,1902945,False,,0.0,,56d63840de071e0100637bff,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:23:51 GMT",agent,US,Greenwood Village,5975 S.

Colorado,CO,1999.0,,agent,"Born and raised in Kansas City, Jennifer moved to Colorado permanently in January of 2000 after graduating from SMU in Dallas, Texas. Growing up, she spent most of her winter and summer vacations with her family in Vail, so moving to the high country was like coming home! In 2001, she realized that she wanted to help others who had dreams of owning a part of the high life that she had watched develop and expand for 30 years, and her real estate career began. 
 
Over 20 years later, she is still doing the same thing...only better!

Jennifer is a proud mother to two beautiful daughters, Brecklyn and Balianna, both born in Vail. They stay very busy as competitive dancers, but even though the girls are often on the move competing, Jennifer's computer is never far away.  As a family, their favorite thing to do is to travel! They love warm weather and try to visit as many places as possible in the US as well as abroad with lots of vacation time spent in sunny, Mexico. In 2021, Jennifer added Cabo San Lucas to her areas of expertise, as an agent with Coldwell Banker Riveras. She now has the ability to personally help her clients in both countries, as well as is able to help with areas outside of the Rocky Mountains or on the Baja thanks to her expansive luxury network.

Colorado,CO,2002.0,,agent,"As a Denver native, I value the place we call home.  I have seen first hand the growth that has occurred throughout the metro area, and this has grounded me, and makes me appreciate my connection to the local communities even more. The most humbling compliment I can receive is the trust my clients put in me to handle their Real Estate transaction. Oftentimes this is a family's most valuable asset, and decisions surrounding Real Estate can be accompanied by life's most stressful transitions. Real Estate is about much more than bricks and mortar, it's about family, memories, and looking towards the future. Before I began my real estate career, I was in the service food and wine business. These experiences prepared me to understand service, luxury client expectations, and I have been jokingly called a therapist for my ability to listen, and walk clients through challenging situations. Outside of real estate, I enjoy teaching snowboarding at the children's school in Beaver Creek, golf, tennis and mountain biking.

With over 40 years as an entrepreneur and business owner there are few questions in the construction business that I have not been asked. I am happy to pass along this experience and share my insight when looking for an existing home, or considering buying or building a new one.

My experience has also lead me to enjoy representing buyers during the buying process . As a buyer's agent, I do not charge a fee to you. This arrangement allows me to represent your interests and advocate for you during the buying process. In the event of a sale, I would ultimately be paid a commission by the listing company.

Since I have mostly lived in and nearby the city of Denver, I focus on the Denver metro cities helping people to buy and sell homes.  I think the Denver area has so much to offer in terms of entertainment, convenience, beauty, recreation and let's not forget places to live!  Knowing a lot about what the different areas in Denver has to offer helps me better guide my client in finding the best home that fits their needs.  I specialize in customer service with my clients making sure they are always fully informed and taking time to really understand their needs in order to make the best use of their time.  Most people typically only buy or sell a home a couple times in their life and I believe it should be as good of an experience as possible.  I also believe you really need someone on your side whom you can trust and cares about what your needs are, someone you can feel comfortable with talking to even after you have bought or sold your home.

Connecticut,CT,2009.0,,agent,"My goal is to make your real estate transaction as smooth as possible. I understand that such a big transition, whether buying or selling your home, can be a scary undertaking, and that is why it is so important to choose a Realtor you can trust, be confident in, and one that you can relate to. I will listen to what is important to you and help you achieve it, through my own personal expertise and widespread resources. I also have a wonderful network of mortgage brokers, attorneys and home inspectors who are a vital part of the transaction. At Page Taft COMPASS, we offer our clients the best of both worlds.  We are a privately owned Real Estate boutique that has been serving the CT shoreline and lower CT River Valley for over 30 years, plus we have the global reach and extensive home buyer & home seller resources from COMPASS. No matter where in the world you are moving, I can help you get there! I entered the world of Real Estate 11 years ago and have never looked back! 

I love helping people buy and sell houses - finding my clients the perfect home is almost as exciting for me as it is for them. Most of my clients become friends through the process and I am so thankful for that. I have been a top producing agent in this office for years, earning the Diamond Medallion for sales in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. I have also been awarded the Five Star Award for excellent customer service in 2014, 2015,2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. I have earned the CRS designation (Council of Residential Specialists) by completing a rigorous course of education, continuing education and selling over 25 million in the past 5 years. In December, I fulfilled a long time goal of passing my Brokers license. 

A sense of community and belonging is important to me. I grew up in RI, where everyone knows everyone. That was important for me to find when I moved away from friends and family. I found just what I was looking for in the quaint and lovely town of Guilford when I move here 20 years ago. As a longtime resident of Guilford, CT, and a mom of three young men, I take pride in enriching our community by volunteering throughout the town and I was honored to win the Community Service Award in 2016 and 2018. I specialize in connecting hearts and homes along the CT Shoreline.

It doesn't matter what the situation is I will go to whatever extent it takes to make it happen. Not every REALTOR can say what the attorney said after a short sale 2023.  This was the most recent transaction that took an unbearable amount of patients and time for myself, client & our attorney. The buyer was extremely lucky to have me as the seller representative otherwise it would have gone south immediately.

""If you ever need a real estate agent… consider Kristen Heinrich. After my frustrating experience, she went over to the bank location in Meriden, which is apparently the corporate office in Connecticut. The employee there I think was so surprised that she showed up and cause no one else was in the office, he reached out to the Chief Operating Officer of the bank, who spoke to Kristen.

Connecticut,CT,2015.0,English,agent,"Proudly born and raised in Branford, Connecticut - and now residing in Fairfield - Andrea has always possessed a keen interest in real estate, architecture, and design. Growing up, her parents owned properties and she vividly remembers the design/build process of her childhood home. Impeccably furnished and appreciated in value, her parents would pop into open houses to see if a home would make them want to sell. Fast forward to today, she's managed multiple renovation projects and lends valuable foresight to clients on design and construction. 

Andrea’s background in marketing and public relations translates to real estate not only by strategically marketing her listings but also by marketing her buyers to peers and having the ability to put together off-market transactions. Being forward-thinking and incorporating her unique ingenuity combined with approachable sales savvy has proven above and beyond results and client expectations. Andrea works with clients seeking all real estate needs: buyers, sellers, investors, and helps clients manage rental portfolios. There is no task too little or large for her - she is always happy to lend advice. 

Invaluable market knowledge, deep community ties, a relentless work ethic, and a continuous strive for growth are what fuel Andrea’s business. Servicing both the New Haven County and Fairfield County market, a wider territory than most realtors, she has made a name for herself across many towns. Andrea also regularly serves as a consultant to local builders and investors lending her guidance on market conditions.

Andrea has built a strong local social media following, amassing over 10,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram, which leads to more eyes on any listing or client need she promotes. She has been featured in multiple media outlets over the years and is continually recognized year-over-year by HomeSnap for customer service and the top 1% of local agents; Property Spark as one of the top Connecticut agents on social media; and Five Star Professional as a Top Producer, among other accolades.

She holds a B.S. in Marketing from Southern Connecticut State University and an M.S. in Public Relations from Quinnipiac University. When Andrea is not working she’s spending time with her family and cooking.",11,https://www.compass.com/,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/3d4487bc2a822ef4894eb9f45c6e137fg-c3724393093s.jpg,,,,4909796,Compass Fairfield,,"06824, 06825, 06828, 06880, 06881, 06612, 06896, 06875, 06611, 06460, 06461, 06897, 06883, 06601, 06602, 06604, 06605, 06606, 06607, 06608, 06610, 06673, 06614, 06615",Agent,True,2020846,False,,5.0,https://forteteamct.com/,56d5539dde071e0100627869,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:34:49 GMT",agent,,Fairfield,1 Sasco Hill Road,,06824,CT,Suite 201,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/7a22c6795df05c6bd63c49e828c9389fa-e2872151861s.jpg,False,,Andrea Viscuso,415884467,Transparent (no color),,Compass,,,,2107942,9,"buyer, seller",True,1.0,Andrea Viscuso,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Andrea-Viscuso_Fairfield_CT_2020846_415884467,,198530534,"Andrea Viscuso, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/cedada7037af3c3dfb79180d409a1d84g-c3129081195s.jpg,Our Forte.

Covering both Fairfield and New Haven Counties, I stay closely attuned to shifts in our local markets—not just town by town, but even neighborhood by neighborhood.

My listings consistently outperform the market average thanks to tailored strategies and creative marketing approaches.

From pre-listing prep—including staging guidance, design-forward upgrades, and professional photography—to high-impact marketing on social, digital, and print platforms, nothing is one-size-fits-all. Your home will be featured across all major platforms (Zillow, Realtor.com, Compass.com, and more), as well as through targeted social campaigns, email marketing, and local networking. We also create high-end print materials, host dynamic open houses, and tap into our local and NYC referral network for additional reach.

Whether you're buying, selling, or investing, my goal is to ensure a seamless, positive experience tailored to your specific needs.

In my earlier years, as a small business owner, I developed a strong appreciation for the passion and dedication that real estate professionals bring to their work.

Connecticut,CT,0.0,,agent,"Born and raised in Fairfield County to an architect and interior designer, the foundation for selling and buying homes was bestowed upon me at a young age. I've had the privilege of being on job sites daily with my father and watching a parcel of land being dug for foundation, all the way to the completion of a new custom construction, including picking the finishes and interior design. Being exposed to the entire process set the groundwork and helped me develop an immense passion for real estate. Most importantly, it taught the value of commitment, hard work and an entrepreneurial spirit. I currently reside in Trumbull, CT and I am the proud father to my daughter, Sofia, whom I consider to be the greatest achievement in my life. Being a father has been a lifelong learning experience and has also helped me understand the needs of a variety of clients, especially families. Whether it's the importance of education in an area, the need for space, first time home buyer jitters, or relocating from another state, I enjoy using my knowledge and experience daily to help my clients make successful life-changing decisions. Over a 22 year career in sales and marketing, both as an individual sales executive and as a director of high performing sales teams, I've spent over fifteen in real estate, mortgage lending, interior design and property rehabilitation.

Connecticut,CT,2020.0,,agent,"Hi! My name is Matthew and this is my good boy Wilson. As a dual-licensed real estate broker in Connecticut and New York, I specialize in luxury properties across Greenwich, Westchester, and surrounding markets. With a deep understanding of what discerning buyers and sellers expect, I bring a refined, results-driven approach to every transaction—balancing data-backed insights with white-glove service.

I’ve built my reputation on trust, discretion, and a keen eye for value in some of the region’s most coveted neighborhoods. Whether it’s a waterfront estate in Greenwich, a historic home in Bedford, or a modern masterpiece in Armonk, I know how to position a property to stand out—and how to identify hidden gems that align with my clients' lifestyles and long-term goals.

Raised with an appreciation for architecture, design, and negotiation, I view real estate not just as a profession, but as a craft. My background in both Connecticut and New York gives me a unique cross-market perspective that benefits sellers looking for broad exposure and buyers searching for the perfect fit.

In 2005, I earned my Associate Broker’s license and relocated to the Washington D.C. Metro area. I love problem solving but believe in business with a personal touch! A bit of a techie, you will rarely see me without my iPhone or laptop, so it is always easy to reach me.

Navigating complex multiple offer situations is one of my favorite parts about my career!

My husband and I own in North Bethesda and my brokerage is headquartered in the District, so I have roots all over the D.C. Metro.

District of Columbia,DC,2005.0,,agent,"Choosing the right REALTOR® to help you buy or sell a home makes all the difference. I put my client's interests first, educating them along the way so they are able to make the best decision for themselves and their families. 
 
I began my Real Estate career in 2005 after working at the University of Maryland in College Park as a Laboratory Coordinator for many years. I loved the idea of helping people buy their first home which was such an important milestone in my own life. Little did I know the real estate market was moments away from a crash. In a way, it worked out well, because I had to work hard to succeed in such a challenging market and I had nothing to compare it to. So if I could make it in that market, I could make it in any market!
 
As the market started to rebound I became interested in the investment side of the business and in 2009 I was able to purchase my first investment property to renovate in Mt. Rainier, MD. I was the project manager and materials go-getter. Wow, what an experience; definitely not what you see on HGTV! I purchased and renovated a second home in Hyattsville, MD and sold my personal residence not long after. I can definitely relate to the stress of homebuying and selling!

More responsibility is on the hands of the managing Broker including supervising agents, contract review, earnest money deposits, training agents just to name a few.  I have been selling real estate since 2004 and focused previously on very complicated transactions with all sorts of title challenges.  I know what it takes to get a seller to the finish line!

I have much lower overhead than the large franchise and no split goes to the house as it is my own company.  This allows for a slight reduction in commission easier for me than a large traditional brokerage.  When the demand is high and inventory is low, the costs associated in marketing the listings for the brokerage are lower as they are typically under contract when priced right in under thirty days. When market fluctuations occur, the fee increases.","I start off at the first meeting providing all of my potential clients a competitive market analysis.  This is my best estimate of what your home will sell for.  This is not an algorithm but an actual report on recent competing sales and active listings.  I offer all of my sellers in all price points a free consultation with a professional home stager.  I only use professional photographers and offer virtual tours on all listings.  I showcase your listing on all of the main platforms including Realtor.com, Zillow.com.  My company has two separate websites where your listing is showcased including video tours on www.metrodmvrealty.com and www.welistdmv.com.  I use paid ads for Facebook around  your open house to generate more traffic for you and mail out to your neighbors for higher turnout for the open house and ultimately multiple

District of Columbia,DC,2009.0,,agent,"Since beginning his career in real estate in 2008, Michael Gailey has quietly become one of the most highly regarded Realtors in the DC metro area. He credits simple things like genuinely caring about his clients, understanding the market, communicating effectively, and paying attention to the details. Michael loves details. He also really loves helping people achieve their real estate dreams. 

""Buying or selling a home is an extremely important life event - both personally and financially,"" Michael says. ""It is a huge thing to be entrusted with, and I treat it with the appropriate amount of care and respect. The most important thing to me is for my clients to be very happy with the end result and very happy with all of my efforts to get us there. That drives everything else. Nobody cares more about doing a great job than I do.” 

Michael was born and raised in Indianapolis and attended Miami of Ohio for college, where he studied marketing, management, and classical literature. This makes him a Midwesterner at heart, but DC is very much his home now. He has spent his last seven years working in real estate here as an agent with one of the top producing offices in the entire country, and he has now joined Compass for its innovative technology and unparalleled agent support. In his free time, Michael enjoys exploring the city with his wife and daughter, seeing live music, and travelling to see old friends. After several years in Mount Pleasant, Michael and his family now live in Glover Park.",0,http://www.compass.com/,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/3d4487bc2a822ef4894eb9f45c6e137fg-c3724393093s.jpg,,,,3374068,Compass,,"20001, 20002, 20003, 20004, 20005, 20006, 20007, 20008, 20009, 20010, 20011, 20012, 20015, 20016, 20017, 20018, 20036, 20037, 20024, 20814, 20817, 20910, 20901, 20912, 20815, 20816, 20902, 20904, 20895, 22209, 22201, 22314, 22301",Agent,True,3267913,False,,0.0,https://www.compass.com/agents/dc/michael-gailey,5a37df0c1d128c00127124e8,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:54:59 GMT",agent,US,Washington,1232 31st Street NW,DC,20007,DC,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/698533929/e1614c3f8a0f24343fc9ccd96d691591a-e0s.jpg,,,Michael Gailey,225104635,Transparent (no color),,Compass,,,,2107942,0,"buyer, seller",True,0.0,Michael Gailey,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Michael-Gailey_Washington_DC_3267913_225104635,,24366440,"Michael Gailey, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1374810292/8d4d538ed2f761e4045b9b4685363eaag-c0s.jpg,"""Nobody cares more about doing a great job than I do.""",False,,,2025-10-08T23:10:10Z,729000,1290000,3,155000,2100000,2025-10-06,42,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Washington_DC, Parcel Return Service_DC, Chevy Chase_DC, Pentagon_DC, North Pole_DC, Chevy Chase CDP_MD, North Bethesda_MD, Bethesda_MD, South Kensington_MD, Westlake_MD, Cabin John_MD, Potomac_MD, West Bethesda_MD, Silver Spring_MD, Takoma Park_MD, Forest Glen_MD, Burnt Mills_MD, Kemp Mill_MD, White Oak_MD, Four Corners_MD, Chillum_MD, Langley Park_MD, Friendship Heights Village_MD, Chevy Chase Town_MD, Chevy Chase Village_MD, Martin's Additions_MD, Somerset_MD, Chevy Chase Section Five_MD, Chevy Chase Section Three_MD, North Chevy Chase_MD, Brookmont_MD, Glen Echo_MD, Wheaton_MD, North Kensington_MD, Glenmont_MD, Beltsville_MD, Cloverly_MD, Colesville_MD, Calverton_MD, Fairland_MD, Chevy Chase View_MD, Kensington_MD, Arlington_VA, Rosslyn_VA, Alexandria_VA, Huntington_VA, Potomac_VA","Washington_DC, Bethesda_MD, Silver Spring_MD, Takoma Park_MD, Chevy Chase Town_MD, Kensington_MD, Arlington_VA, Alexandria_VA","Buyer Representation, Seller Representation, First Time Home Buyers, Investors, Luxury Properties, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_1F691F62,0225229052,FAR_1F691F62,0225229052,FAR_1F691F62,,FAR_1F691F62,,,,,"1232 31st Street NW, <NA>, Washington, DC 20007, US",(202) 448-9002,Office,(202) 448-9002 (Office),,,(240) 393-2717,Mobile,"(240) 393-2717, (202) 386-6330","(240) 393-2717 (Mobile), (202) 386-6330 (Office)"

Delaware,DE,2015.0,,agent,"Hello Everyone! 

My name is Amanda (McNulty) Vachris. I am a Pennsylvania and Delaware Realtor. I also have a bachelors degree in Marketing from East Stroudsburg University. Real Estate has been a passion of mine for quite some time. When I was younger, I grew up watching my father renovate houses for a living. The best part of being a Realtor is being able to help someone find their ""dream home"" and/or sell their current home to move on to the next chapter in their life. I represent my clients with their best interest in mind and making sure the process goes smoothly for them. I will work my hardest to find you that ""dream home"" or a buyer for your current residence.  I would love to help with anything you may need, buying or selling, I will be here to help! 

I'm not licensed in the area you are looking to buy or sell? Not a problem! Contact me and I can help find you a reputable Real Estate agent for that area. 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Delaware,DE,2007.0,English,agent,"The primary goal of The Josh Behr Group is to guide our clients through the exciting step by step journey to and from home-ownership! Whether you're selling, buying, or investing in today's challenging marketplace, our objective is provide the highest level service, professionalism, and more importantly, results! Knowing that there are so many agents in the marketplace that rely on old fashioned & passive techniques when selling real estate, Josh Behr continues to focus on using the latest technology available to assist our clients in both the purchase and sale of a home. What separates Josh from his competition is his hungry and drive to continue to learn. He's hyper-focused on education, not only for himself but for his team. ""He gets after it"" is a common term his past clients use when describing how he gets their homes sold so quickly. Josh actively prospects 3 hours a day looking for buyers for his sellers and vice versa. Each member of The Josh Behr Group has a deep commitment to ethical integrity. They work with their clients to find out their true needs and wants, and find the best solutions for them. They save sales other agents would let slip away, and stop sales that aren't in the best interests of their clients, even if it means losing the sale! It's not all work and no play. When Josh is out of the office, he loves seeing the world with wife and two kids. And by world, I'm pretty much just talking about Disney. They are Disney Fanatics!!! Josh also enjoys running, playing basketball, and is a huge Philly Sports Fan! The Josh Behr Group has over 20+ years of Real Estate Experience and have helped over 750+ clients buy, sell, and invest in real estate during that time. Ask Josh what his primary goal is and he will passionately say ""I want to do such a great job helping you, that you'll refer me to all your family and friends.

1.) Price - Both Agent and Seller agree on a price

2.) Placement - Agent places the listing in the MLS and their sign on the lawn.

3.) PRAY! - Many think their job is done once the Seller signs the listing agreement. It’s NOT!

The reality is, in this day and age of digital marketing...a Real Estate Agent better have their A-Game on or else they’re going to get left in the dust. This is the major cause of a house Expiring on the market. There’s really only two factors....Price and how well it was advertised. Many Realtors will blame price but in reality, it was their own lack of marketing that will cause a home not to sell.

Running a Facebook Ad isn’t easy. It takes time and skill to create an effective targeted Ad. I’ve been doing Social Media Management and Digital Marketing since 2008. I don’t really blame other Agents for not knowing what to do. You either jumped on when this took off back in the day or you were left behind and now you’re playing years worth of catch-up.

Door knocking is another one. Everyone hates it, including me, but the fact is that I’m out there pounding pavement because it works! I would love to sit in an air conditioned office all day and wait for an offer to come in but if an agent isn’t PROACTIVE then the listing simply isn’t going to sell quick...or maybe not at all.

The Derek Doernbach Team with HomeSmart First Advantage Realty has a proprietary system in place that gives us a heatmap and a powerful database which allows us to laser target individual’s based on buying habits and what they are looking at online.

In closing, I'd like to ad that this is my full-time job. I take it seriously but more importantly, I love what I do and I love meeting new people and establishing long-term professional relationships with them. I have my own books out and I'm also a Director on the Atlantic City & County Board of Realtors.",2025-10-08T22:03:08Z,11900,399000,6,1000,385000,2025-07-15,24,False,,534435282.0,Derek,Doernbach,,,,,,,,,"With interest rates rising and almost no inventory, we're seeing houses that are priced right go pretty quickly. Without the right price and marketing, some are sitting on the market longer than they should. We will have to price competitively to stand out from the others and I will need to place targeted ads in areas where the Buyers are.

Delaware,DE,0.0,,agent,"Dana is a full-time Realtor at Weichert Realtors-First Class in Dover, DE. She specializes in residential sales, military relocation, transfers and First-Time-Home-Buyers as a Buyer’s Agent. She was the office Top Producer in 2016 and received honor into the Weichert Realtors Executive Club, for Outstanding Sales Performance in 2016. 

Where are Dana's listings? As a premier Buyer's Agent, Dana's one and  ONLY job is to be your professional real estate source of information, education and services to purchase a new home. In the state of Delaware, the seller pays all the Realtor fees. By no means do you simply hire a Realtor. You hire Dana's experienced team of experts who work diligently around the clock to make the process go smoothly at no cost to you.

 Why do you need a Buyer's Agent? Before you call, ask yourself these questions:
 1. How much time do I have to study the market and really know what is going on to negotiate the best price?
 2. Do I have the technology to find the most complete listings in my budget? 
 3. Do I have access to the very best resources or have long-term relationships with local service providers to best suit all my needs throughout the sale? 
 4. How will I protect my personal and financial information entirely?
 5. Will I have the time and skills necessary to deal with industry professionals …who do NOT have my best interest at heart?
 6. Am I comfortable in my knowledge of national and local real estate laws?
 7. Can I effectively negotiate every aspect of the sale from purchase price to closing date?
 8. Who will be by my side when the unexpected happens? 

These are just some of the ways Dana works for you. She is  your detective, your defender, your negotiator, your connection, and your resource. Remember: Sellers WILL be well represented, shouldn’t you be too? You don’t have to go it alone.

Originally from Ohio, Dana gained her degree in Respiratory Therapy prior to a long career in behavioral health and social work. Dana lunged into the industry of real estate sales after several years of management experience. Dana is the mother of two children with her husband  who proudly and currently serves (over 19 years) in the USAF. She understands that HOME is where your family is and knows exactly what it takes to make a house feel like your home.

Delaware,DE,1982.0,,agent,"Hello and thank you for considering The Lee Ann Wilkinson Group of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices PenFed Realty for your real estate search.  I've lived in Lewes, Delaware practically my entire life and love it here. It’s a tight-knit community that really focuses on keeping a great quality of life and enjoying our unparalleled natural landscape. Lewes frequently tops the media's ""best places to live"" lists - including Coastal Living Magazine's. The primary reasons are the low state-wide taxes and the beautiful beaches in Sussex County.

Real estate taxes here typically hover around 1,200 +/- per year! We are also ""tops"" because of our clean, safe, access-anytime beaches; the historic Victorian architecture within the town and all the outdoor activities available year-round. Plus, 
the state is sales-tax free; which is a real treat when paired with the 130 Tanger Outlet stores just down the road in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

I am a REALTOR and enjoy selling at the beach. My team and I have been top sellers in Sussex County for well over a decade - which I believe is due to our true enjoyment in matching buyers and sellers.  We work 7 days a week. If you are looking for a condo in Rehoboth, Historic downtown Lewes home, Dewey beach town house, or anything else in Sussex County, Delaware, just ask. I am happy to help anytime!",195,http://www.leeanngroup.com,,,,,,0,Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices PenFed Realty,Community Minded . . .

Hawaii,HI,2023.0,,agent,"Born and raised in Hawaiʻi, I have a deep-rooted love for our islands and an even deeper commitment to serving the people who call this place home. As a real estate advisor with Engel & Völkers Honolulu, my mission is simple: to provide honest, personalized, and strategic guidance to help you achieve your real estate goals—whether you’re buying your first home, selling a property you’ve outgrown, or making smart investment moves.

I began my career in sales helping people find the right car, and although I excelled in that role, I knew I wanted to make a more meaningful impact. That led me to real estate, where I now have the opportunity to guide clients through one of the most important decisions of their lives. My approach is grounded in integrity, patience, and care. I don’t just want to close a deal—I want to be a trusted advisor you can count on for years to come.

At Engel & Völkers, I’m backed by a global brand with a luxury reputation, powerful marketing tools, and a network that stretches far beyond Oʻahu. I pair that with my local knowledge and a strong work ethic to give clients the best of both worlds—big brand resources with boutique-level attention.

I specialize in helping first-time homebuyers feel confident and informed throughout the process. I also work with sellers looking to maximize their home’s value with strategic pricing and marketing. Investors appreciate my research-driven mindset and eye for opportunity in Hawaii’s ever-changing market.

While I proudly serve clients all across Oʻahu, I have a particular focus and deep connection to the Windward side—especially the Kāneʻohe area. Having spent years getting to know the unique communities, neighborhoods, and lifestyle of Kāneʻohe, I bring insight and expertise that helps my clients navigate this special part of the island with confidence.

I understand that no two clients are alike, and that’s what makes this work so meaningful. Whether you’re downsizing, relocating, or simply curious about the market, I’m here to listen, answer your questions, and help you make smart, informed decisions—without pressure.

Let’s connect and see how I can help you move forward with clarity and confidence.",0,https://honolulustadium.evrealestate.com,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/4e8fbc3b9b898e7b6085187191b554ccg-c520660439s.jpg,,,,3209861,Engel & Volkers Honolulu Stadium,,96744,Agent,True,100412021,False,,0.0,https://dylanfujimoto.evrealestate.com/,65c39262be214eb5775ce3fb,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:24:57 GMT",agent,,Honolulu,4510 Salt Lake Boulevard #B4,,96818,HI,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/82815e2f86d1831729947d973d2aad06a-e1290566406s.jpg,False,,Dylan Fujimoto,391644486,#050505,,"Engel & Volkers Americas, Inc",https://ap.rdcpix.com/e4dd5c55f5abc357882926ba95977f90k-c204084009s.jpg,True,https://youtu.be/VIXAbft-3qY?si=pcb0DQ00SnPndZ70,1700479,0,"buyer, seller",True,11.0,Dylan Fujimoto,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Dylan-Fujimoto_Honolulu_HI_100412021_391644486,,534916860,"Dylan Fujimoto, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/a0f80f361cc19895e31177a3f6d2628eg-c4175041544s.jpg,We link together the aspirations of people around the world.

Illinois,IL,2015.0,,agent,"Embarking upon a real estate journey is rarely just about buying or selling a home. It is often driven by or part of a life changing decision and the start of an exciting new chapter. Shanon Tully therefore believes that real estate experiences should be all about you…your story, your goals, and your life’s destinations. Just as no two properties are alike, every buyer or seller is also unique and deserves special attention. With her client-centered philosophy, Shanon is a proficient guide who can lead you to where you want to go on your own real estate journey.

Given her background in nursing, Shanon appreciates that the best relationships are based on effective communication, ongoing collaboration, and mutual trust. Serving a variety of clients from first-time home buyers to seasoned home sellers and investors, Shanon has a wealth of knowledge and experience to expertly guide her clients with dedication and a commitment to service that consistently drives results. Her clients have come to rely upon her discretion and empathy as much as her business acumen and remarkable negotiating skills. At every step of the process, Shanon becomes your steadfast champion, your loyal confidant, and many times your friend.

A residential listing specialist, Shanon thoroughly enjoys helping clients achieve their goals, and particularly relishes the unique challenges associated with staging, redesigning, and marketing properties.

Shanon has had a passion for real estate for as long as she can remember but embarked upon her real estate career later in life. She began her professional career as a registered nurse at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and worked there for over a decade while earning a master’s degree in nursing from Rush University. After taking a break to focus on her young family for a few years, the time was finally right for Shanon to pursue her dream and begin a challenging but rewarding career in real estate. Shanon soon realized that the personalized attention, empathy, and listening and communication skills she had learned, and the commitment to patient objectives she practiced every day in healthcare, transferred beautifully to her career in real estate and working with clients. It’s what constantly motivates her to see her clients as unique persons with individualized needs, and not just customers. Many have marveled at the difference Shanon Tully has made in their real estate journey. Without a doubt, you will too.

Indiana,IN,2024.0,,agent,"Hi, I’m Andrew Larson—a proud lifelong resident of Columbus, Indiana, and someone who believes deeply in the power of community, connection, and place. I’m married to my best friend and together we’re raising three amazing sons and two lovable dogs. If you spend much time around Columbus, you’ve probably seen me running through the neighborhoods, walking the dogs near Donner Park, or riding my bike through town.

For over 26 years, I’ve been an educator at Columbus Signature Academy New Tech High School and Columbus North High School, where I’ve had the privilege of teaching science and language arts. Whether it’s been in the classroom or out in nature, I’ve always focused on helping young people explore their world and discover their potential.

In 2024, I took my love of working with people, my knack for renovation, and my passion for this community and launched a new chapter—real estate. It was a natural next step. I’ve spent years renovating homes, both our own and various flip and rental projects, gaining hands-on experience in what makes a house not just structurally sound, but truly feel like home. I love the process, the potential, and the story each home tells.

My roots run deep in Columbus. I’ve lived in five different homes all within a mile of Donner Park over the last four decades. I know the neighborhoods, the trails, the shortcuts, and the soul of this town. More importantly, I know what it feels like to fall in love with where you live—and I want to help you find that feeling too.

I have been helping people buy and sell homes for over 16 years. With a passion for helping others and a wealth of experience in the real estate industry, I have earned a reputation as an excellent advisor to many homebuyers and sellers in the market.

I graduated from the University of Kansas back in 2000 and I hold a degree in computer science and electrical engineering. I am truly passionate about real estate and I love doing what I do so I have changed my career to a full-time real estate agent as well as an investor with multiple properties in my portfolio. I have a six-man crew that I manage on the construction and remodeling side of my business. With such a solid foundation in the field, I have been able to provide clients with personalized advice and guidance on a wide range of real estate matters.

But what truly sets me apart is my dedication to helping people. I genuinely care about my clients and take the time to understand their unique needs and preferences. Whether it's finding the perfect home or negotiating the best deal, I am always looking out for my client's best interests. Best of all, I am REACHABLE when many aren’t in this industry. 

In addition to my professional accomplishments, I am also a devoted family man. I have a beautiful family of four, including two boys and an amazing, supportive wife. With such a strong support system, I am able to focus on my clients and provide the best possible service.

Finally, I have a diverse background which adds another layer of value to my services. I come from a Nepalese (Nepal) heritage and have lived in multiple countries during my elementary to high school years, including England, Hong Kong, Nepal, India, and Tanzania (Africa). As a result, I have developed a multilingual skill set and an appreciation for diverse cultures. This makes me uniquely qualified to assist clients from all walks of life and backgrounds.

Overall, I consider myself a true gem in the real estate industry. With my experience, passion, dedication, and diverse background, I would be the perfect partner for anyone looking to buy or sell a home.

Kansas,KS,2004.0,Spanish,agent,"I consult, negotiate and oversee the details of the transaction on your behalf. 
It is important you know I have the time for you. 
I help people understand the tax advantages, financing alternatives, and investment aspects of home ownership and why now is an incredible time to buy. 
My specialty is making dreams come true by helping home Buyers, Sellers and Investors save money. 
I love what I do.  I strive to provide my clients the highest level of service and give them the best advice based on the newest information. 
Whether you are buying or selling a home, I will strive to earn your trust, confidence, respect, and business.

Education is the Key to Success.  
I firmly believe that continually educating oneself is the key to personal success as a Real Estate Agent and Professional Investor. 
This is the main reason my clients are so satisfied during and after the sale of their home. While most agents are only taking the minimum mandatory classes to keep their license up-to-date, I am seeking out exceptional classes that dig deeper into various aspects of real estate. When education classes will not come to Kansas, I travel to them.
I have earned the following designations that set me apart from most Real Estate Agents: 
Accredited Buyer Representative ABR, 
Certified Residential Specialist CRS, 
e-PRO Internet Professional e-PRO, 
Graduate Realtor Institute GRI, 
National Valuation Standards Institute Broker Price Opinion NVSI,
Residential Finance Consultant RFC, 
Short Sale and  Foreclosure Resource SFR, 
Masters in Public Administration,
as well as being a Bilingual Agent.
Masters Club Bronze Award in recognition of closed transactions by the Sunflower Association of Realtors.
Just like I told Muhammad Ali, I’ll fight for your best interest.
The finest complement I can receive is a referral from my valued customers. 
A referral is sending someone you care about to someone you trust.

Kansas,KS,0.0,,agent,"I became a Real Estate Agent after 25 years as a teacher and principal. My father told me I’d make a great realtor, because as an experienced educator I could teach people how to buy and sell houses.

In 2005 I followed dad’s wisdom and got my real estate license. 

A perfect fit; I love what I do because:
★ Real estate I is about education. 
★ It’s about hands-on caring for clients.
★ It’s about communicating with the universal language of listening, responding and helping others reach their goals.

WHO I WORK WITH
I represent buyers and sellers in the greater Kansas City area. Often I have the opportunity to work with former students, or international clients who may have studied in the States and now work in Kansas or Missouri.  My international clients tell me they appreciate the time I take with them to bridge the cultural gap and make them feel part of our community.

I also work with clients who choose to build new homes. I know the often-missed details of working with builders. My experience gives clients the confidence to move forward through the PROCESS OF NEW HOME BUILDING.

HOW I WORK WITH CLIENTS
First and foremost, I work around my clients’ schedules. We all have busy lives. It is my goal to make the process as non-disruptive as possible. Once we agree on what works for you, we develop a plan of action tailored to you and your needs. I set dates and deadlines for the process including paperwork. And, of course, I help you follow the schedule by reminding you of key dates so everything runs smoothly.

Like a tenured educator, I actively guide buyers and sellers to make sure they get what they want. I’m proactive and check in often during the process.

Interested in buying or selling a house in Leawood, Overland Park or Lenexa, Kansas? I specialize in Johnson County and Jackson County neighborhoods. I look forward to helping you and welcoming you to my client family.

Kentucky,KY,2004.0,,agent,"I moved to Louisville about 23 years ago as a reporter and anchor for TV news (I had worked all over the United States as a journalist). My wife Norine ( who passed away in early 2016) and I fell in love with Louisville, the people, their friendliness and  the cleanliness of the city. As an anchor and reporter I was constantly looking to increase the size of the market I was working in.  But there was a trade-off for those moves, every time we changed cities we had to sell the home we were in and find a new home in the city we were moving to. Each time we found it to be a scary process. We had no one to turn to, real estate laws were different in every city and we found there was no one we could trust. When I changed careers 16 years ago and turned to real estate, Norine and I decided we would create a team of experts, the best agents in the city. The goal for our team was simple, our clients would never, ever, feel the way we felt whenever we moved. We would eliminate the feelings of uncertainty for our buyers and sellers, spend as much time with them possible, guide them and assure them at every turn. We now have a team of 10 agents, we’re ranked number 1 in the city 11 years in a row and two of our 3 kids have joined us in the business of real estate.

Kentucky,KY,2013.0,,agent,"I’ve been in real estate full time with Semonin Realtors since 2013, working primarily in the Louisville area and surrounding counties residential markets with sellers, buyers, investors, first time home buyers and those downsizing.

Since 2013, I’ve been a Multi-Million Dollar Producer and most years a Top Producer. In 2021, my business grew extensively taking me to the next level of Presidents Club.

Home is Louisville, Ky., but I've lived primarily in Oldham County for the past 20 years. I enjoy the big trees and quieter small town atmosphere. My daughter, Savannah graduated high school in 2021 and is attending college at JCTC. We have 2 rotten dogs and 2 spoiled cats we love like family. Prior to real estate, I retired from Louisville Metro Police Dept. (2009) where I worked as a detective in the Crimes Against Children Unit and a patrol officer primarily in the 3rd Division (Churchill Downs area). Police work taught me so much about the city, it’s
neighborhoods and nuances. It also taught me strong negotiation skills and the ability to think on my feet which is more than helpful in my real estate career.

Outside of work I enjoy boating at Cumberland Lake with family, trying new restaurants with friends, refurbishing/painting old furniture and relaxing on my front porch.

Real estate for me is challenging and enjoyable. Everyday is an opportunity to help my clients reach their goals. Home ownership is the American dream, a place to love and call home, a place to build wealth and a place to feel safe and secure.

Louisiana,LA,2007.0,English,agent,"I grew up in New Orleans and learned at a young age what hard work entailed. I learned a lot from my mother who started her own successful and still thriving tourism business 39 years ago. At the age of 10, I started my first job by cleaning her tour vans every day. This was after a full day of school, then either: football, baseball, track, or Karate practice. During this time, I also earned a second-degree black belt in Taekwondo. Just a few years later, I acquired a brown belt in Judo and Jujitsu and later won a gold medal in the junior Olympics in Judo. This work habit continued all the way through my college athletic and academic career. After graduating from Archbishop Shaw High School in 2002, I attended LSU and played football for the Tigers for the next 5 years. In 2003 we won the National Championship! In 2007, I graduated from LSU and pursued a real estate profession. I continued working hard for the next 8 years continuing to grow a very prospering real estate career. I then attained my Broker’s license and founded Pennant Real Estate. In the last 4 years, we have grown to just over 30 Realtors. We currently rank in the top 2% of all real estate companies in Baton Rouge. I have built strong relationships with local banks, loan officers, appraisers, and inspectors in order to offer our clients the best experience and foresight to proactively address details before they become a problem. We work hard for our clients to inspect, maintain, and communicate every detail of the transaction, from the first phone call, all the way to the closing table. My wonderful wife and 3 amazing kids are the reason why I do what I do. They are my “WHY” and what pushes me every day to get up before everyone else and go to bed later than everyone else.

Louisiana,LA,2006.0,,agent,"I became an active real estate agent in 2006. I worked as a Real Estate Closing Secretary/Notary as well from 1998-2009.  I feel that I can be placed at the top of the 'best of the best' list because I have a special understanding of the real estate transaction from start to finish.
I made my first sale within the first month as an agent. My first client was a first time homebuyer and many of my other clients have been first time homebuyers. I have helped clients find office space to lease as well as homes/condos to lease. I have stepped into a little bit of all that real estate has to offer. 
I feel that as an agent I am able to work well with all types of clients and because of my 'special understanding' of the real estate transaction I would be the best agent to work for you. 
In 2013 I partnered with Joann Bernard to form “The Hammond Team” together we have over 30 years real estate experience to offer you or someone that you know who is looking to buy/sell/lease.
As a real estate professional I am here to work for my clients. I work to find what they want and have the knowledge to guide them through the real estate transaction. Having worked in the real estate field as a Real Estate Closing Secretary/Notary for over 10 years I feel that I am very well informed on the real estate transaction and have the ability to work closely with my clients to answer any questions they may have. I have an understanding of my area and know what our area has to offer. I am available to work with first time homebuyers, relocation buyers, second home buyers as well as sellers. I am also available to assist you for investment property, residential or commercial for purchase or lease.
In 2013 Joann and I were Multi-Million Dollar producers as well as receiving the International President’s Circle award.

Louisiana,LA,2002.0,Spanish,agent,"Jason Riggs was born in Washington D.C. and raised in Arlington, VA. He developed an affinity for real estate at an early age after being dragged around, along with his twin sister Sarah, to more open houses than either of them could count, by their mother, a career Realtor in Washington, DC.

He attended Tulane University and graduated from the A.B. Freeman School of Business with a degree in Finance. During this period he obtained his Real Estate Salesperson’s License and worked alongside a high-end, top-producing residential agent in New Orleans.

Jason is obsessed with New Orleans' historic architecture. A serial renovator, he has rescued and restored numerous blighted properties within New Orleans' historic districts. Jason loves sharing his knowledge and passion for all things New Orleans with his clients while helping them navigate the intricacies of purchasing, selling, or leasing real estate. He specializes in historic homes, investment properties with or without tax credit benefits, first-time homebuyers, and REO/bank owned/foreclosure properties.

In 2014, Mr. Riggs created Historic Pro NOLA, a New Orleans-based historic rehabilitation and real estate development firm with completed properties in the Irish Channel, Uptown, and Treme, with more projects underway in the Milan neighborhood. He recently received a Louisiana Landmarks Society 2019 Awards for Excellence in Historic Preservation for the restoration of a c. 1880's Greek Revival Sidehall Shotgun home in the Treme.

Jason resides in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans with his wife, Susan, an elementary school teacher and Algiers native.

Massachusetts,MA,1986.0,,agent,"I have been a Realtor since 1986, and have owned Colonial Manor Realty in Reading, MA along with my business partner Bobbie Botticelli since 1989. Through the years, we have been a huge company, a medium sized company, and a small company. What I have learned is that you don't need to be HUGE to be the BEST. I think right now we are somewhere between medium and small...but one fact remains, we truly are the BEST. All of us at Colonial Manor Realty take great pride in providing dedicated, knowledgeable, and detailed service to our many clients. Our Goal is to always provide that personal touch...whether buyer or selling a studio condo for 69,900, or buying that dream home for 1.5 million. EVERYONE deserves top notch, personalized service. Having enjoyed working through the years as a serious fundraiser for such causes as local food pantries and for creating awareness of many social issues...I earned my auctioneers lic. a few years ago so that I can professionally assist other's in their fundraising efforts. I have enjoyed great success in raising thousands and thousands of dollars...even in a sluggish economy.

Massachusetts,MA,2003.0,,agent,"I have been licensed in real estate in Berkshire County since 2003 and have consistently been a top producer since becoming a full time Realtor in 2005.  

I hold three highly sought after and respected national designations as an Accredited Buyers Representative (ABR), a Certified Residential Specialist (CRS), Pricing Strategy Advisor (PSA), through the National Association of Realtors.  I have also earned and continue to maintain my Accredited Staging Professional (ASP) designation.

As a results oriented Realtor, I work with both Sellers and Buyers throughout the Berkshires striving to provide the highest level of professionalism, experience, knowledge, integrity and care to all of my customers and clients. 

My professional memberships include the National Association of Realtors; the Massachusetts Association of Realtors; the Berkshire County Board of Realtors; the Council of Residential Specialists; and the Real Estate Buyers Agency Council.  

My Client-First Philosophy: 

There are many qualities and skills that go into being an excellent real estate professional: integrity, in-depth community and market knowledge, marketing savvy, effective negotiation skills, and a high-quality professional network. All of which are hallmarks of how I work.

Throughout my career as a Berkshire County real estate professional I have found that providing the very best service is essentially all about putting my clients first! This means keeping myself accessible, being a good listener,  a skilled communicator, a savvy negotiator, and responding quickly to your needs.

This philosophy has always been my approach and it requires me to continually improve my skills and ways of doing business. In addition, I've found that the latest technologies are enabling me to do everything I've always done, only much more quickly, effectively, and efficiently while helping me to extend the range of services I provide to my clients.

Massachusetts,MA,0.0,,agent,"Welcome!
I am fortunate to live and work in the Pioneer Valley!  Before beginning my career in real estate with Jones Group Realtors, I was a high school English teacher, coach of three Varsity sports teams,  and an owner of a highly successful Amherst Bed and Breakfast. It was the quality of life here in the Amherst area that brought us here with our three children; Ethan, Erin, and Chad 14 years ago.

My experience and expertise lies in Residential and Commercial Properties. If you are a seller, I will get the job done. If you are a buyer at any life stage, I have the energy and time for you. I love my job, am a full time Realtor, and  a top agent here at Jones Group .

I live with my family in Hatfield. We involve ourselves in many varied pursuits and take advantage of all the valley has to offer whether it is the concert scene, myriad restaurants, or miles of hiking trails. How can I help you find the perfect town or community to suit your passions, interests, or careers?

I welcome the opportunity to help you find a home or sell your home! As a well-respected member of the community, I can promise professional, competent, and thorough service for you and your family.

From our first meeting to beyond the sale, this commitment to providing my services to you, as a seller, is what has garnered my reputation and consistently brings referrals to my business. You wouldn't want a Realtor to simply cast you off once the listing agreement is signed. With me, each step of the process is constantly communicated, I will bring exceptional photography including aerials, 3-D tours, floor plans, staging if necessary, and highlight features of your home and town you live in in the best light possible. Having been in the Newburyport area for over 20 years, I know Newburyport and how each surrounding city and town is unique, having worked with local town boards and attorneys to bring each and every transaction seamlessly to the finish line.

The pandemic started it, and now rising interest rates contribute to the lack of properties on the market. Though there are higher interest rates, buyer demand remains. The market will not balance itself out until more sellers decide to sell, and when this happens, it will dampen buyer demand. Market trend wise, renovations in Newburyport and the surrounding areas continue to fetch top dollar. As always, correctly pricing your home is and always has been what will sell it. Since the pandemic has subsided, and though buyer demand continues, buyers are also starting to push back and not bid $100k over asking. Don't get me wrong, it still happens, but if you overprice your home in today's market, it will sit. Having a local Realtor on your side who knows today's market is more valuable than any seller can imagine.","Marketing properties for sale happens to be one of my favorite aspects of being a Realtor. Online, my social media platforms include Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter) to name a few. Your home will be shining through posts and boosted posts around a 50-mile radius to Boston and beyond. My attention to detail will highlight special areas of your home that aren’t often highlighted by other Realtors, such as sunsets, or how light is cast through windows throughout the day. These small details really bring in your buyer to want to take a visit into your home. Offline, I produce high quality mailers distributed to a wide net of prospective buyers - and within Stone Ridge Properties, our office locations will also be promoting your property in window displays and in the local newspaper.",,,,,,,,"Newburyport_MA, Merrimac_MA, West Newbury_MA, Haverhill_MA, Amesbury_MA, Amesbury Town_MA, Newbury_MA, Groveland_MA, Salisbury Beach_MA, Salisbury_MA, Hampton Beach_NH, Hampton_NH, North Hampton_NH, South Hampton_NH, East Kingston_NH, Seabrook_NH, Seabrook Beach_NH, Exeter_NH, Brentwood_NH, Kensington_NH","Newburyport_MA, West Newbury_MA, Amesbury_MA, Merrimac_MA, Newbury_MA, Groveland_MA, Salisbury_MA, Hampton_NH, North Hampton_NH, East Kingston_NH, Seabrook_NH, Exeter_NH, Greater Newburyport Area, Southern NH","Residential, ABR®, New Construction, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent","ABR, CRS",FAR_19FC1E36,,FAR_19FC1E36,,FAR_19FC1E36,,FAR_19FC1E36,,,,,<NA>,,,,,,(978) 270-1460,Mobile,(978) 270-1460,(978) 270-1460 (Mobile)

Massachusetts,MA,2010.0,,agent,"Having lived and worked in the Metrowest area my entire life, I’m proud to call this community home. I grew up in Newton and now live in Natick, and over the years I’ve owned property in these and many other nearby towns, including Needham, Holliston, and Framingham, as well as on the beaches of Cape Cod and in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Helping clients discover the full range of what Greater Boston has to offer remains one of the most rewarding aspects of my work in real estate.

After earning a degree from Simmons College in Boston, I began my career in interior design, curating finishes, fixtures, and furnishings for high-end residential and commercial spaces. A few years later, I expanded into real estate investment. I began designing, renovating, and building my own residential properties, and became a licensed real estate agent in 2010.

I spent many years as a Realtor with a boutique firm, guiding clients through purchases and sales across Massachusetts. My work has been particularly focused on communities such as Natick, Newton, Needham, Wellesley, and Weston, where I’ve developed deep market knowledge and long-standing relationships. After earning my broker’s license, I recognized an opportunity to deliver a more refined, client-centered experience. That vision shaped Board & Park, the independent brokerage I built and led for nine years, and now guides my work at The Agency Boston, where I continue to mentor agents and provide my clients with the same personalized service they've come to expect.

When I’m not working with clients or supporting our agents, I enjoy spending time with my family, volunteering at a local farm sanctuary, skiing, running local trails, and traveling whenever I can.",12,http://www.boardandpark.com,,,,,685904055.0,0,The Agency Boston,,"01760, 01770, 01778, 02030, 02435, 02458, 02459, 02460, 02465, 02466, 02467, 02468, 02482, 02492, 02493",Broker,True,1875734,False,,5.0,www.boardandpark.com,56d5f9938a13600100d6be78,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 08:29:30 GMT",agent,US,Newton Highlands,43 Lincoln Street ,,02461,MA,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d0acf9d9408c9302303e76c99da2b358a-e1954956597s.jpg,False,,Victoria Keith,886944055,,,,,,,0,0,"buyer, seller",True,6.0,Victoria Keith,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Victoria-Keith_Newton-Highlands_MA_1875734_886944055,Tory,99312170,"Victoria Keith, Broker",1,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/g169f1c00-c0od-w1200_q50.jpg,,True,,"I am the broker and owner of my firm, Board & Park.

Maryland,MD,1994.0,,agent,"Hello, I'm Amy Citrano with Berkshire Hathaway Homesale Realty.  I'm a full-time Realtor representing Buyers, Sellers, Landlords and Tenants in all price ranges, with all types of properties, in many different locations.  I specialize in various counties in Maryland, including Anne Arundel County, Carroll County, Baltimore County, Harford County, Howard County and the surrounding communities in those areas.  Myself or my associates can help you or someone you know with Real Estate locally, state-wide, nationally or internationally.  No matter what your Real Estate need may be, you can turn to me for assistance.  My objective is to provide you with as much information as I can to help you make well-informed decisions with ease and confidence.

I constantly update and expand my knowledge of the Real Estate profession by regularly attending education classes. These range from Ethics to Fair Housing, Legal Updates to Agency Relationships and much more.  I am a member of the Local (Carroll County Realtors), State (Maryland Realtors) and National Associations of Realtors (NAR), the BRIGHT Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and was a Lifetime Member of the Carroll County Million Dollar Real Estate Professionals Association. I hold the ABR (Accredited Buyer Representative) designation, the GRI (Graduate of the Realtors' Institute) designation, the SRS (Seller Representative Specialist) designation and the SSRS (Short Sale Resolution Specialist) designation.  I am also a Certified Leasing Agent (CLA), a Certified Pricing Strategy Advisor (PSA) and am MD Workforce Housing Certified.  Only a small percentage of Realtors hold these designations and certifications. 

On July 31, 2019, I decided to switch real estate companies and join Berkshire Hathaway Homesale Realty.  I felt this company was on the cusp of being very sought-after by consumers and wanted to become a part of it before that breakthrough happened.  Not only was I looking to grow my business but I was also looking for better services for my customers and clients.  I love the family feel at Berkshire, the strong managerial support and purple is my favorite color!

Prior to being with Berkshire Hathaway, I was with Coldwell Banker.  Here are some awards I earned while with that company.  For April 2018 month to date, I was number 20 in Coldwell Banker's Top 100 agents in the Greater Baltimore Metro area.  For April 2018 year to date, I was number 38 in Coldwell Banker's Top 100 agents in the Greater Baltimore Metro area.  For April 2018 year to date, I was number 72 in Coldwell Banker's Top 100 agents in the Mid-Atlantic area.  For May 2018 year to date, I was number 69 in Coldwell Banker's Top 100 agents in the Greater Baltimore Metro area.  For June 2018 year to date, I was number 94 in Coldwell Banker's Top 100 agents in the Greater Baltimore Metro area.  For September 2018 month to date, I was number 100 on Coldwell Banker's Top 100 agents in the Greater Baltimore area.  In December 2018, I was number 1 for the Carroll County Regional Office's Top Individual Agents based on new listings and number 4 for the Top Individual Agents based on sales. For 2018 as a whole, I was number 2 for the Carroll County Regional Office's Top Individual Agents based on new listings and 4 for the Top Individual Agents based on sales. 

Whether Buying your dream home or Selling your present one, I am here to guide you throughout each step from start to finish.  I understand how challenging and exciting Real Estate can be.  My goal is to make things easy for you and it is my intention to be your ""Go-To"" Realtor, so Target a Professional, and Aim for Amy! Remember - now you have a friend in the real estate business.

For most people, buying or selling a home is the biggest financial investment of their lives. Although it may initially seem overwhelming, it doesn't have to be. With the proper education and support, buying, selling or investing in real estate can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I am a licensed Realtor and believe every client deserves the highest level of Loyalty, Honesty and Diligence when conducting business in real estate. 

""Knowledge is power"" and I encourage you to ask me any questions you may have. I believe purchasing a home is an investment in your future. It is the number one way well-known individuals and ""investors"" have built generational wealth. Allow my teammates and me to show you how the numbers work in real estate, and how they will build you wealth for years to come! I have an investing background in real estate and can offer a unique perspective. When I first got started years ago, I suffered from what many first time home buyers do: ""Analysis Paralysis"" - the phenomenon where too much research and analysis can actually hamper your ability to take action and get started! My teammates and I will give you the tools, knowledge, experience and guidance needed to TAKE ACTION and get started! Call, text or email us with questions or for advice anytime. 

I graduated from the University of Delaware in 2010 with a Bachelor's of Science in Accounting. I became a licensed real estate agent in 2016 and have since assisted over 400 clients. Our team has sold more than 150,000,000 dollars of real estate since Day 1! We are consistently ranked in the top one percent of Realtors in the region and have been awarded the President's Award for Top Sales at our brokerage in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. When I'm not selling houses or mentoring the team, I enjoy riding my Harley through Anne Arundel County or spending time at the beach on our beautiful Eastern Shore! We look forward to meeting you!",1,https://godouglasrealty.com/,,,,,927384345.0,2159465,Douglas Realty LLC,,"21122, 20711, 20724, 20733, 20751, 20755, 20758, 20764, 20765, 20776, 20778, 20779, 21012, 21032, 21035, 21037, 21054, 21056, 21060, 21061, 21076, 21077, 21090, 21106, 21108, 21113, 21114, 21123, 21140, 21144, 21146, 21226, 21225, 21240, 21401, 21402, 21403, 21404, 21405, 20732, 21045, 21044, 21046, 21043, 21041, 21042, 21222",Agent,True,2756245,False,,5.0,http://www.joshshapiroteam.com,581252b8f14ffc01001ffd62,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:57:07 GMT",agent,US,Pasadena,"8585 Ft.

Part of the magic is held within what we as Mainer’s have to offer each other. Our unique small businesses, family farms, shopping locations, and culinary experiences cannot be matched!

My prior professional experience includes partial ownership of a successful construction company. We specialized in both residential construction/remodeling and the purchase, rehabilitation, and sale of homes. 

My Investment experience led to my passion for real estate. I found so much joy in enhancing a property in every way possible, making it something to be proud of, and offering it to someone who now calls it home. It is a privilege to be a part of such a monumental experience in someone’s life!

As a homeowner, and someone who has bought and sold multiple homes in the past; I understand how exciting, yet stressful, (and at times confusing) purchasing/selling a home can be.

Professional Experience

Prior to becoming a licensed Realtor I had, and continue to, enjoy the creative aspects and ever evolving technology of manufacturing signs. My family's business was established in 1948 by my parents. Sadly Dad is in a better place while Mom is still very much involved on a day to day basis. In addition to over 30 years in graphic design and management within that business I have been listing and selling Real Estate since January of 2002. Real Estate is my passion.

Professional Education and Designations

I am an Associate Broker and member of the Bangor Board of Realtors, Maine Association of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors. At my previous Agency I was named Top Producer for 2007.

Maine,ME,2005.0,,agent,"I work  in the same area I grew up in. West Paris was my home town in my childhood years and presently I live in Oxford with my husband Ryan and our two youngest sons, Davis and Eli.  Our oldest son, Dexter is married. Dex and his wife Andrea have made their own home in our beautiful area. Living here in the Oxford Hills all of my life has not only given me a great knowledge of the area, but also a great love and appreciation of its history.  I stayed in the Oxford Hills area to give my boys the same happy childhood as I had.  Life has been very busy watching the boys play football, hockey and the many other activities. 

In October of 2010, I opened Bearfoot Realty!  My dream had always been to be a business owner. After spending 16 years in banking and an additional 5 years in business management, I found my love with real estate. Thank you to my husband Ryan for encouraging me to spread my wings. 

I have enjoyed being a Board of Director for the Western Maine Board of Realtors for several years.  I was its President in 2011 and 2012.  In 2013, I was awarded the Realtor of the Year for the Western Maine Board of Realtors. This award is very special to me. Thru my many years of real estate, I have attended numerous educational classes and seminars, spent many hours on Realtor boards and donated many hours and dollars to support my community. 

I am honest, ethical, ambitious, loyal, friendly, creative, and a downright hardworking girl. My reputation means everything to me and I commit to continue to increase my popularity base. Hard work and honesty are key to being successful in any business, especially real estate.

Michigan,MI,2011.0,,agent,"I was lucky to grow up in a small Michigan town with the coolest name, Bad Axe!  It was there where hard work and an appreciation for life became the foundation to the start of this thing I call my life.
I received my Bachelors degree in Business Management from Northwood University in the spring of 2006 and two days later I started my professional career in the hospitality industry in Charleston, SC.  In my time there, I was fortunate to have great mentors and meet lifelong friends.
However, life took us on a detour through Chicago where I decided to take a residential real estate class.  Shorty after, my then fiancée Bethany and I moved back to Michigan where we settled in Metro Detroit. That is when I mortgaged the future, pun intended, and completed the state of Michigan real estate licensing exam and officially became a Realtor.
Being a residential Realtor allows me to have a lasting impact on every home buyer and seller I have the pleasure of coming in contact with.  It is the bonding of my small town roots, experiences in southern hospitality and desire to deliver the most outstanding experience imaginable that has lead me to a career I could not be more passionate about!

One of my favorite movies of all time is the Disney movie, UP.  A home is such a basic and sacred need, that the protagonist of the story--Carl--ties hundreds of balloons to keep his house!  Buying or selling a home is a complex, sophisticated, and often deeply personal endeavor.  My husband Mark, a licensed carpenter for 22+ years, keeps me knowledgeable with house layouts.  Also, I have aligned myself with an exceptional, and experienced team at Keller Williams Showcase Realty in Commerce/ Milford--in order to deliver both good results and an enjoyable experience.  

MY VALUES
I value relationships more than transactions and quality over quantity. My business is built on integrity and perserverance.

Minnesota,MN,2019.0,English,agent,"Chris Goble and Kay Johnson are passionate about promoting homeownership for marginalized communities and are At Home With Diversity® Certified. They believe that equitable treatment is crucial for all buyers and sellers and that everyone deserves a fabulous place to call home.

Born and raised in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, Chris & Kay are lifelong residents and have called Minneapolis home for over 20 years.

Chris began his real estate journey in 1994 under his mom’s guidance, helping her host an open house at a Parade of Homes listing, along with many years working alongside her helping with clients. In 2019, after more than two decades in mortgage finance, he obtained his real estate license following his mother’s retirement. Since then, he has diligently honed his skills, specializing in strategic listings for maximum return.

Kay is a US Air Force and real estate veteran who obtained her license in 2004 and has been a full-time agent ever since. Previously, she had her contractor’s license, which brings unique and valuable evaluation skills to the house hunting process. Kay is known for her candidness and approaches every showing as an educational opportunity in homeownership.

In 2025 Chris and Kay co-founded True Colors Real Estate. Together, they deliver unparalleled guidance and are proud members of the RE/MAX Results family, Twin Cities Quorum, and LGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance.

With their extensive knowledge of the Twin Cities and surrounding suburbs, Chris and Kay offer strategic, client-focused expertise tailored for an outstanding experience.

Fun Facts:

Minnesota,MN,2012.0,,agent,"I am passionate about customer service! With an extensive background in this industry before the attainment of my career in real estate. My focus is to always give the highest quality of attention, respect, diligence, loyalty, dedication, and appreciation to my clients. 

While living in Denver in 2012 I acquired my real estate license and had the great fortune of joining Volante Realty. This experience allowed me to learn how to be a Realtor® while being an Executive Assistant for Volante Realty. The amount of experience I acquired while working with them on each of their files as well as with each of their clients have been unsurpassable. This also allowed Michael and Dan to spend more time with and pay more precise attention to their clients.

In October 2013 I founded Resourceful Real Estate Solutions LLC. This company is geared toward helping real estate agents accomplish goals that they can not obtain on their own.

Shortly after moving home to Fargo in 2015 I found my new home in Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Premier Properties. The training, support, technology, culture and global reach that my brokerage provides me are simply unobtainable at any other real estate company in my area. 

In recent years involvement and charity have become a huge part of who I am. I have been blessed to be elected as a director for NDAR as well as the Vice President for FMAAR. The knowledge I have obtained and the connections I have made with local industry professionals are more than I could have ever imagined. Being able to give back is so important to me as well. I help out wherever I can, the charities I serve the most are; Sunshine Kids, Feed My Starving Children, Rebuilding Together, Habitat For Humanity and The United Way. 

In 2019 I also acquired my AHWD - At Home With Diversity certification as well as my C2EX - Commitment to Excellence endorsement through NAR. In 2020 I was able to obtain my e-PRO designation. These simply help me raise my professionalism and provide even better service to my clients. To me, it is about relationships, not numbers. I want my clients to be extremely happy with the guidance I provide them. Life long clients and friends are the business I am building. My mission is to help you achieve your goals. Whatever it is you need help with and however long it may take, I am here for you. I can't wait to help you buy, sell and invest in Real Estate.

Lakefront homes and properties near popular outdoor attractions like Pelican Lake and golf courses are seeing strong buyer interest. Additionally, there's a growing trend toward vacation rentals and second homes, with buyers looking for investment opportunities or personal getaway spots.

However, while demand remains high, inventory has been limited, leading to increased competition among buyers and steady price appreciation. Properties that are well-maintained and move-in ready, or those offering additional amenities like ATV trails, modern upgrades, or recreational features, are attracting higher offers and selling faster. Buyers are also increasingly seeking energy-efficient upgrades and low-maintenance features in their homes, reflecting a shift toward long-term value and convenience.","Our online strategy includes featuring property listings on major real estate platforms like MLS, Zillow, and Realtor.com, while also prominently showcasing them on our company website. We leverage social media, with regular posts on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, using themes like 'Featured Properties'  to engage potential buyers. 

Our offline marketing strategy includes hosting open houses and property tours, such as ATV rides for large-acreage listings, giving buyers a firsthand experience of the property.

Minnesota,MN,2007.0,,agent,"Jill Johnson
I have more than 10 years of experience as a realtor, working tirelessly to help people buy and sell their homes since day one. Getting my feet wet as a realtor during the worst real estate market, I quickly learned what it takes to succeed and persevere. As an active participant and influencer in today's rebounding market, my excitement for homeowners and homebuyers grows each day.
I have lived in Central Minnesota all my life. My husband and I have raised three wonderful children on our family farm, where we thrive and make new and creative ideas come to life. I enjoy cooking what we grow in the garden and hosting our family and friends, especially on long, cold Minnesota winter evenings. This lifestyle has taught me the value of hard work, and I bring that focused strength to you. 
As your realtor, I will be there every step of the way with honesty and integrity. Whether searching for your perfect home or helping you sell and move on, I strive to exceed your expectations. My innovative marketing strategies, strong negotiating skills and passion for helping people will save you time, money and hassle. Give me a call, and let me be your guide.

Sam Johnson 
Being a realtor allows me to blend my background in large-scale land use and building projects with my love for helping people. After graduating from the University of Minnesota-Duluth with a degree in civil engineering, I worked at Braun Intertec alongside developers, public agencies and builders to assess project sites for geotechnical and environmental risk. At Ames Construction, I was involved in pursuing highway, railroad, mass transit, energy, mining and commercial work across the Midwest and U.S. My time as an engineer in the construction industry will be invaluable to you if you are buying or selling commercial real estate. 
Growing up on a farm and working on large-scale farming operations in Central Minnesota instilled a strong work ethic and perseverance in me at a young age, and those lessons stick with me today. As your realtor, I will approach every situation with a sense of urgency and give you an honest hard day’s work, every day.",2,parcel.properties,,,,,,0,Parcel Real Estate,,"55309, 55330, 55369, 55371, 55374, 55376, 56302, 56303, 56304, 56310, 56320, 56329, 56330, 56367, 56369, 56372, 56374, 56377, 56379, 56393, 56395, 56396, 56397, 56398",Agent,True,1586816,False,,3.0,http://parcel.properties/,56804886bb954c010068d186,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 07:24:57 GMT",agent,US,SAINT CLOUD,229 5TH AVE S,,56301,MN,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/61b1a5725df972788dabb735b5966a88a-e4051049299s.jpg,False,,Parcel Real Estate,816394305,Transparent,,Parcel Real Estate,,,,0,110,"buyer, seller",True,11.0,Jill Johnson,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Parcel-Real-Estate_SAINT-CLOUD_MN_1586816_816394305,,23184923,"Parcel Real Estate, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/78df02614511afa0ea6012e55acdde0fg-c3752766188s.jpg,Make Your Move!,True,,,2025-10-09T11:42:09Z,579000,719000,2,97000,715000,2025-09-12,32,False,,,Jill,Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Monticello_MN, Becker_MN, Big Lake_MN, Otsego_MN, Elk River_MN, Burns Township_MN, Nowthen_MN, St. Francis_MN, Osseo_MN, Maple Grove_MN, Rogers_MN, Dayton_MN, Dalbo_MN, Princeton_MN, Santiago_MN, Corcoran_MN, St. Michael_MN, Hanover_MN, St. Cloud_MN, Sartell_MN, Avon_MN, Collegeville_MN, Cold Spring_MN, Rockville_MN, Ronneby_MN, Gilman_MN, Foley_MN, Foreston_MN, Rice_MN, St. John's University_MN, St. Joseph_MN, Sauk Rapids_MN","Big Lake_MN, Elk River_MN, Osseo_MN, Princeton_MN, Rogers_MN, St. Michael_MN, St. Cloud_MN, Avon_MN, Cold Spring_MN, Foley_MN, Foreston_MN, Rice_MN, Rockville_MN, St. Joseph_MN, Sartell_MN, Sauk Rapids_MN","Residential/commercial Sales, Foreclosures, Re location specialist, River/Lake properties, Short Sales, Resedential, commercial, First Time Home Sellers, First Time Home Buyers, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_1E3E1E43,,FAR_1E3E1E43,,FAR_1E3E1E43,,FAR_1E3E1E43,,,,,"229 5TH AVE S, <NA>, SAINT CLOUD, MN 56301, US",(320) 224-1970,Mobile,(320) 224-1970 (Mobile),,,(320) 224-1970,Mobile,"(320) 224-1970, (320) 420-1177","(320) 224-1970 (Mobile), (320) 420-1177 (Mobile)"

Minnesota,MN,2015.0,,agent,"Lisa Malley 
My passion in life is God, family, and good friends. To be an inspiration to others, connector and a part of people’s stories in their lives through real estate. 
I offer comprehensive real estate services to both buyers and sellers. My clients receive the best hands-on approach because I aim to make it very straight forward. I am committed to providing the best experience that gets them to their goals, and making sure my clients’ best interests are represented in everything I do for them. I have obtained additional training in representing clients during the probate process and helping Seniors move in the right direction with their housing needs. As well as a Buyers Representative designation and Military relocation designation.
With my in-depth knowledge of the ever-changing real estate market, clients receive the best in innovative systems, all with a high-level standard of professional conduct and ethical services. My unique specialization is my focus on Life transitions; Divorce: Untangling Lives, Unraveling Homes; Downsizing: Simplifying Life’s Canvas, Diapers: Expanding the Nest for Growing Families, Diamonds: Celebrating Milestones and Upgrading Homes, Death: Navigating Transitions with Grace.
I have a proven track-record and have gained vast knowledge during my time in real estate. In addition to selling homes, I am part of a team of 50+ other highly skilled agents in both MN and FL, all of us working collaboratively to get the job done right. It is the relentless pursuit of improving lives through homeownership and providing ethical results in Real Estate that I find the most rewarding. 
In addition to real estate, I am on Several Chambers of Commerce committees, and enjoy volunteering for various programs including local law enforcement community events, Magnus Veterans Foundation and Forest Lake Ambassadors.  
When I’m not selling homes, you may find me out gardening, scrapbooking, crafting, hosting bonfires and dinner parties, travelling to the North shore or checking out new local craft breweries. I'm also a yoga enthusiast, love to travel to Mexico, and I'm happiest in the sun with my toes in the sand. 
I’m originally from Crystal MN (besides a brief stint in North Dakota and Montana); wherever my family is is where my heart calls home. I am filled with gratitude to have such a wonderful family – my husband Dale of 40 years, three adult children; Brent, Christine Shawn, 4 grandchildren; Isaiah, Keaton, Liberty and Hadley 2 cats; Mac and Stevie, 1 puggle Tessa and a whole flock of chickens!",4,,,,,,,4065225,Exp Realty,,"55005, 55008, 55011, 55014, 55025, 55038, 55040, 55056, 55070, 55079, 55092, 55110, 55112, 55126, 55303, 55304, 55316, 55330, 55371, 55398, 55421, 55432, 55433, 55448, 55449",Agent,True,2142915,False,,5.0,https://mn.exprealty.com/agent.php?&agentid=1071346,56d6718ab5cc660100bd53ce,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:56:39 GMT",agent,US,White Bear Lake,4525 White Bear Parkway,,55110,MN,Suite 122,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/8adbf15baf77aa9e3ffb481078902a0ca-e1007670524s.jpg,False,,Lisa  Malley,185889394,,,Exp Realty - Broker,,,,3662449,2,"buyer, seller",True,8.0,Lisa  Malley,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Lisa--Malley_White-Bear-Lake_MN_2142915_185889394,,247578034,"Lisa  Malley, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d93470297b5cd7e1a68c082012fc57fbg-c1104049249s.jpg,Malley Moves MN,True,,,2025-10-09T10:14:31Z,190000,600000,5,238750,762500,2025-08-21,14,True,3651965.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bethel_MN, Linwood_MN, East Bethel_MN, Oak Grove_MN, Cambridge_MN, Cedar East Bethel_MN, Cedar_MN, Columbus_MN, Blaine_MN, Circle Pines_MN, Lino Lakes_MN, Lexington_MN, Forest Lake_MN, Chisago City_MN, Wyoming_MN, Centerville_MN, White Bear Township_MN, Hugo_MN, Isanti_MN, Lent_MN, Stacy_MN, North Branch_MN, Sunrise_MN, Chisago Lake_MN, Nowthen_MN, St. Francis_MN, Martin Lake_MN, Gem Lake_MN, White Bear Lake_MN, Birchwood Village_MN, Vadnais Heights_MN, Grant_MN, Dellwood_MN, Arden Hills_MN, New Brighton_MN, Mounds View_MN, Roseville_MN, Shoreview_MN, Little Canada_MN, Ramsey_MN, Anoka_MN, Champlin_MN, Ham Lake_MN, Andover_MN, Otsego_MN, Elk River_MN, Burns Township_MN, Dalbo_MN, Princeton_MN, Santiago_MN, Zimmerman_MN, Columbia Heights_MN, St. Anthony_MN, Hilltop_MN, Fridley_MN, Spring Lake Park_MN, Coon Rapids_MN, St. Paul_MN, Minneapolis_MN","Bethel_MN, Cambridge_MN, Cedar_MN, Circle Pines_MN, Forest Lake_MN, Hugo_MN, Isanti_MN, North Branch_MN, St. Francis_MN, Stacy_MN, Wyoming_MN, St. Paul_MN, Anoka_MN, Andover_MN, Champlin_MN, Elk River_MN, Princeton_MN, Zimmerman_MN, Minneapolis_MN, Anoka County","Investment, first time home buyer, Listing agent, Accredited Buyers Representative, Military Relocation Representative, Foreclosure, Short Sale, Senior transitions, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",MRP,FAR_1E3E1E43,,FAR_1E3E1E43,,FAR_1E3E1E43,,"FAR_1E3E1E43, FAR_1B7A1E9D, FAR_1EA81E43",,,,,"4525 White Bear Parkway, Suite 122, White Bear Lake, MN 55110, US",(612) 751-9303,Mobile,(612) 751-9303 (Mobile),,,(612) 490-7024,Mobile,(612) 490-7024,(612) 490-7024 (Mobile)

36 years of advertising and marketing experience.  Great transition into becoming a realtor, but what does that really mean to you?
In the marketing world we are taught to learn enough about someone’s business to market it!  In real estate, learning your needs, concerns, and future goals is critical to a successful sale or purchase.  
Let’s talk about what it is going to take to make your transaction successful.  
Is this your first house?  An investment?  Land?  Condo? Are you raising a family?  Starting a business?  Downsizing?  Vacation home?  Farm?  
Each of these scenarios has different needs, concerns, and goals. 
Buying or selling, commercial or residential.  Lived on a farm for the last 27 years, so land is a specialty.
Let’s get together and talk about your real estate needs.

Inventory is low due to sellers sitting out waiting for interest rates to adjust (which experts predict will happen) and buyers are a bit cautious for the same reason.  With that being said, there are still people who are relocating for jobs, making major life changes, etc. which is still driving listings and sales.  It is still a good time to buy or sell a home on the MS Gulf Coast.","Online marketing includes the best professional photography, video, 3D tours, drone shots, and other techniques to show your property in its best light.  From there, social media sites such as FaceBook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and others are used.  Targeted, boosted advertising is run to attract the right buyer for a particular property.  As a Coldwell Banker listing, from the MLS the listing is fed to many websites including all the popular consumer facing sites such as Zillow, Realtor.com, and Homes.com to name just a few.

Revitalizing the Historic City Hall building in Old Town Bay St. Louis, Holly built a thriving business with the Cypress Café. Locals would enjoy lunch by the giant Shoofly and sip sweet tea out of mason jars while children played in City Park.Prior to opening the Cafe, Holly worked for the Hollywood Casino (formerly Casino Magic) where she excelled in areas such as Marketing, Public Relations, VIP & Casino Host Services. Leveraging her vast experience and knowledge of marketing, budgeting, and most importantly, her commitment to customer service, Holly knows just how important dedication, honesty, hard-work, and ethics are and puts them to work for her clients.

Using various networking opportunities, innovative marketing techniques, high energy, and a personal touch to provide the best buying and/or selling experience, her clients love working with her.

Holly’s talents go beyond taking care of people. She has a passion for interior design and brings life to items others may toss aside. After being a Realtor for less than two years, Holly got her Broker’s license and turned an old shoe store in to an Industrial, chic office. While Holly was busy designing her new office, she also renovated a condo and an old, abandoned gas station.

When she’s not working a contract, re purposing an abandoned building or showing houses, Holly likes to spend time with her husband Leo, and her son Landry checking off bucket list items, swimming with sharks, or hanging out on their rescue farm where they care for animals such as peacocks, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, goats and a cow.

Holly has been featured on HGTV’s Beachfront Bargain Hunt, Season 13, Episode 4, Also seen on GAC’s “You Live In What” Season 4, Episode 7, and several magazines ranging from Gulf Coast Woman, South Mississippi Living, and Realtor Success(ion).

Holly knows that none of her success would be possible without the support of her family, community, and most importantly, her clients.

Mississippi,MS,0.0,,agent,"I am a lifelong resident of South MS and have been in the real estate industry since 2015.  I enjoy helping people get through the important yet sometimes confusing process of home buying and selling.
In business, I strive to be both professional and pragmatic treating my client’s needs as my own and having a healthy sense of responsibility to them. Above all else, I want my clients to feel comfortable and confident in my capacity to effectively guide them through the entire process.  I study the housing market regularly and stay current on market trends which allows me to better help clients make informed decisions concerning what will likely be one of the largest purchases they will ever make. I believe my ability to really connect with clients helped me to earn more than 60 listings in the first 1 ½ years of my real estate career.
I am happily married with two children and devoted to my faith and family.  When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband and children and being active in community activities.  I am a member of First Baptist Church of Lucedale and the local chapter of Rotary International which both provide multiple avenues for service to others. 
In relation to business and life in general, I apply the belief that you earn back what you put into things, and hard, thorough work pays off.

Montana,MT,1977.0,,agent,"I was born and raised in Missoula, attending Loyola High School and the University of Montana.
From 1977 to 1985, I was a real estate agent in Missoula specializing in residential and income
properties. From 1985 to 2003, I moved to Eastern Washington, working for a ConAgra division
as Credit and Finance Manager. With my background in real estate, I also became responsible
for that division’s commercial real estate acquisition and disposal, as well as new construction.
Returning to Missoula in 2004 to care for my ailing mother. From 2004 to 2006 I was a general
contractor and successfully completed 2 subdivisions and built and sold homes. Have been an
active full time realtor again since February 2007.
Having been born and raised in Missoula, I have witnessed a great deal of change here in the
beautiful Missoula Valley, and I make the most of living here. My interests in motorcycling,
hiking, and fishing keep me outdoors in these great valleys as much as time allows! Western
Montana has so much to offer I really don’t need to travel anywhere else to enjoy pristine
streams and lakes, beautiful mountain passes, or rugged and majestic mountains!
Attended University of Montana (Go Griz!), ITT Consumer Finance, MANY Real Estate based
educational seminars.
I am a charter member and serve on the Board of Directors for Bikers Against Bullies USA. We
provide education, support, and fundraisers to aid in the anti-bullying efforts within our
schools. Formerly a member of the now disbanded Guardian Angels, a non-profit organization

Oncologist who was head of it moved). Member Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Member of
Missoula County Board of Realtors, and am involved and serve with the Missoula Board of
Realtors. Certified Residential Specialist and Certified Short Sale and Foreclosure Specialist. I
was one of the first Realtors in Missoula to obtain the C2EX certification, which stands for
Commitment to Excellence.

Growing up in a small agricultural community in in South Dakota, I fully understand the importance of honesty, family, and hard work.

I have gained experience with first time and repeat buyers and sellers. Thanks to my wonderful clients and friends, I am a proud recipient of the 2017 Quality Service Award.

Maybe you are just curious about the market and love homes. Whatever the reason, I am happy to talk to you about what interests you and what you might be looking for in a home or an investment property.

North Dakota,ND,2012.0,,agent,"I am passionate about customer service! With an extensive background in this industry before the attainment of my career in real estate. My focus is to always give the highest quality of attention, respect, diligence, loyalty, dedication, and appreciation to my clients. 

While living in Denver in 2012 I acquired my real estate license and had the great fortune of joining Volante Realty. This experience allowed me to learn how to be a Realtor® while being an Executive Assistant for Volante Realty. The amount of experience I acquired while working with them on each of their files as well as with each of their clients have been unsurpassable. This also allowed Michael and Dan to spend more time with and pay more precise attention to their clients.

In October 2013 I founded Resourceful Real Estate Solutions LLC. This company is geared toward helping real estate agents accomplish goals that they can not obtain on their own.

Shortly after moving home to Fargo in 2015 I found my new home in Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Premier Properties. The training, support, technology, culture and global reach that my brokerage provides me are simply unobtainable at any other real estate company in my area. 

In recent years involvement and charity have become a huge part of who I am. I have been blessed to be elected as a director for NDAR as well as the Vice President for FMAAR. The knowledge I have obtained and the connections I have made with local industry professionals are more than I could have ever imagined. Being able to give back is so important to me as well. I help out wherever I can, the charities I serve the most are; Sunshine Kids, Feed My Starving Children, Rebuilding Together, Habitat For Humanity and The United Way. 

In 2019 I also acquired my AHWD - At Home With Diversity certification as well as my C2EX - Commitment to Excellence endorsement through NAR. In 2020 I was able to obtain my e-PRO designation. These simply help me raise my professionalism and provide even better service to my clients. To me, it is about relationships, not numbers. I want my clients to be extremely happy with the guidance I provide them. Life long clients and friends are the business I am building. My mission is to help you achieve your goals. Whatever it is you need help with and however long it may take, I am here for you. I can't wait to help you buy, sell and invest in Real Estate.

North Dakota,ND,2007.0,,agent,"Straight talk... the key to your next move.

What I love about real estate is that it's NOT about selling houses, it IS about creating long lasting relationships with my clients and friends. Helping them make the best possible choices for the next stage in their life is the life I treasure. Whether you're a first-time buyer, moving up to make room for more family or a different lifestyle, even downsizing as life changes, there is always a solution to keep you moving forward with the right home. Oh, the fun we'll have on the way!
I have traveled a very circuitous route to find the work and life that I truly love. Since attending UND, I’ve been a locksmith, bartender, auction clerk, high school speech coach, collections officer, sales manager, computer programmer, and several other highly varied occupations. Without this meandering path, I would not have found my calling creating long lasting relationships with clients and friends, helping them make the best possible moves for their lives. I have two grown children and am still madly in love with my husband. I love my work, my connections, my city and all of the wonderful experiences that come with new and familiar faces alike. My promise is straight talk as we get to know each other and I understand better what you want and need most in your next move.

Nebraska,NE,2010.0,"English, Swedish",agent,"My name is Camilla (think Pamela) Knapp, and I have a diverse background that serves me well in Real Estate. I was born and raised in Sweden, (yes Europe) and came to Nebraska in 1990. I fell in love with the people and the land, and ended up making it my home. A few years later I found a man who captured my heart. We have two beautiful girls that are now in college. My husband introduced me to country music and Nebraska football while I introduced him to gourmet cooking. Together we have moved/relocated a lot for his career. I have practiced Real Estate in multiple states and that has given me valuable skills. We continue to enjoy traveling and spending time with friends and family, but love that we are back in Nebraska!

When it comes to Real Estate I personally pledge to serve my friends, neighbors, and clients with honesty, integrity, and competence.

I work with buyers on their unique needs to find them the perfect home to fit their situation. When it comes to selling homes, you get open and honest communication about your property. We will analyze the data and put together a listing that we can all be proud of. As a business developer I can help you put a portfolio of income generating properties together so you can earn substantial income! I have a great understanding for relocation needs both international and domestic, and many years in the human capital field makes me a great asset when it comes to the overall experience of home buying.

Nebraska,NE,2025.0,,agent,"Born and raised in Yankton, South Dakota, I bring deep local knowledge and a strong sense of community to every client I serve. My passion for real estate stems from the joy of helping families find more than just a house—I help them discover a place to grow, to gather, and to make lasting memories.
The best part of Yankton isn’t just its scenic beauty—it’s the culture of community and togetherness that makes it truly feel like home. That spirit is what drives me to ensure every client feels welcomed, supported, and confident throughout their journey.
Whether I’m guiding first-time homebuyers or helping a family find their dream lakefront property, my goal is to be a highly competent, trustworthy, and approachable advocate every step of the way. I take pride in understanding my clients’ needs and making the process feel both exciting and seamless.
Outside of real estate, I’m a lifelong lover of books, creative writing, photography, and the great outdoors. If I’m not showing homes, you can probably find me enjoying nature trails, lakeside activities, or capturing the beauty of a South Dakota sunset with my camera.

Helping others find the house of their dreams is my dream!","What sets me apart from other agents in representing sellers is my unwavering commitment to providing exceptional service and results. As part of my approach, I bring unique advantages that ensure your home stands out in a competitive market.
One of the key differentiators is that I work with the only company that offers a home warranty with every listing. This added benefit provides buyers with peace of mind and significantly enhances your home's marketability. Not only does this protect the buyer from unexpected repair costs, but it also makes your home more attractive, ultimately increasing the chances of a quicker sale at a higher price.
Additionally, I take pride in offering exclusive showcasing for your listing. This isn’t just about putting your home on the MLS. I go above and beyond with premium marketing strategies, such as professional photography, video tours, virtual staging, and targeted digital ads, ensuring your home is seen by the right buyers. Whether through social media, online listings, or email campaigns, your home will be front and center, catching the eye of motivated buyers.
I also focus on providing a personalized experience that caters to your unique needs. From pricing your home strategically to negotiating on your behalf, I work tirelessly to ensure that you get the best possible outcome. My proven track record of successfully closing deals, combined with my deep knowledge of the local market, allows me to guide you seamlessly through every step of the selling process.
Ultimately, it’s about more than just selling a property – it’s about achieving your goals, and I’m here to ensure your home gets the attention it deserves with unmatched support, marketing, and expertise.",2025-10-08T23:17:06Z,77500,750000,11,10000,605000,2025-09-29,70,False,,,,,68118.0,US,331 Village Pointe Plaza,Omaha,NE,https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlaUF5gycF8?modestbranding=1&rel=0,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pierce_NE, Hadar_NE, Norfolk_NE, Woodland Park_NE, Battle Creek_NE, Belden_NE, Allen_NE, Martinsburg_NE, Brunswick_NE, Carroll_NE, Bazile Mills_NE, Creighton_NE, Elgin_NE, Hoskins_NE, Laurel_NE, Lynch_NE, Monowi_NE, Madison_NE, Meadow Grove_NE, Neligh_NE, Newman Grove_NE, Niobrara_NE, Verdel_NE, Santee_NE, Spade_NE, Oakdale_NE, Foster_NE, Osmond_NE, Pilger_NE, Plainview_NE, Sholes_NE, Randolph_NE, Royal_NE, Stanton_NE, Tilden_NE, Willowdale_NE, Verdigre_NE, Wausa_NE, Wayne_NE, West Point_NE, Winside_NE, Wisner_NE, Aten_NE, Crofton_NE","Pierce_NE, Norfolk_NE, Battle Creek_NE, Belden_NE, Allen_NE, Brunswick_NE, Carroll_NE, Creighton_NE, Elgin_NE, Hadar_NE, Hoskins_NE, Laurel_NE, Lynch_NE, Madison_NE, Meadow Grove_NE, Neligh_NE, Newman Grove_NE, Niobrara_NE, Oakdale_NE, Osmond_NE, Pilger_NE, Plainview_NE, Randolph_NE, Royal_NE, Stanton_NE, Tilden_NE, Verdigre_NE, Wausa_NE, Wayne_NE, West Point_NE, Winside_NE, Wisner_NE, Crofton_NE, Northeast Nebraska","RIS, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_1EA81E9E,,FAR_1EA81E9E,,FAR_1EA81E9E,,FAR_1EA81E9E,,,,,"1310 N 13th Street Suite 4, Suite 4, NORFOLK, NE 68701.0, US",(402) 371-3469,Office,(402) 371-3469 (Office),,,(402) 613-1278,Mobile,(402) 613-1278,(402) 613-1278 (Mobile)
Nebraska,NE,2015.0,,agent,"What is your background?
I grew up in Elkhorn, NE where my parents were both teachers and my dad coached high school football. After coming to Lincoln in the fall of 1989 I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology then married my husband Justin.  We loved the city of Lincoln so we decided to stay and have invested in the community for almost 20 years.  Before having children, I held a marketing position at Back to the Bible and worked alongside Elisabeth Eliot to promote her radio program, Gateway to Joy.  While taking care of our two boys full-time, I served on the PTO at their elementary school and was a small group leader for a mom’s group for many years.  Now, our children are much older and I love helping people buy and sell real estate!  I consider it an honor and privilege to serve you – please call me!

If you could take a trip anywhere in the world. Where would it be?
Anywhere with my family. 

What did you want to be when you grew up?
I wanted to be an actress.  Growing up, my friends and I would imitate The Sweeney Sisters which was a skit from Saturday Night Live.

What single event/person/thing has most changed your life?
When I was 16 years old my dad turned his life around.  He took steps to make amends with people he had hurt.  His sincere humility along with a changed life deeply affected me.  Sadly he passed away 6 years later but his influence on my life will last forever.

What do you like most about helping people buy and sell a home?
My husband and I have lived in two different homes where we created many precious memories. Those homes served a special purpose and met our needs at the time.  We all go through different stages in life and a home should meet the needs of whatever stage you’re in.  Whether you’re wanting to downsize or whether you’re busting at the seams, I would love to help you transition onto that next stage. Please call me for a complimentary consultation.

The pandemic started it, and now rising interest rates contribute to the lack of properties on the market. Though there are higher interest rates, buyer demand remains.

Market trend wise, renovations in Newburyport and the surrounding areas continue to fetch top dollar. As always, correctly pricing your home is and always has been what will sell it. Since the pandemic has subsided, and though buyer demand continues, buyers are also starting to push back and not bid $100k over asking.

Loving all that Southern New Hampshire has to offer (Less than an hour from beaches, lakes, mountains & Boston), Scott & Jillian decided to settle in Londonderry.  Their extensive combined knowledge of the local communities helps provide their clients with a great understanding of what their future home town can offer. 

Scott graduated from the University of New Hampshire Whittemore School of Business with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and a concentration in finance and management.

After graduating college Scott obtained a decade of project management experience which he has naturally transitioned into helping to facilitate each of his clients real estate transactions from beginning to end. He executes a client experience that is proactive, easy to understand and customer focused. 

Jillian graduated from Babson College with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. She obtained eight years of experience as a director in the staffing industry. Throughout this time she obtained and managed Fortune 500 client accounts. This experience helps her excel at strategically marketing your home as well as obtaining and negotiating every aspect of the transaction.  Her focus is creating superior client experiences and going above and beyond to make your real estate experience exceptional.

Together, Jillian and Scott are committed to providing you with a seamless real estate transaction with unmatched customer service. This commitment has lead to a client portfolio based almost solely on referrals. 

While the home buying experience is brief, the relationship lasts a lifetime.

Personal yet unique.

Exceptional is our standard.

New Hampshire,NH,1989.0,,agent,"Moe Archambault is a passionate go-getter when it comes to real estate. For more than 30 years, he has personally negotiated over 1400 real estate transactions for his clients. Being a real estate agent in New Hampshire means you don’t often take weekends off, and working late into the evening is just part of the job.

Moe continually invests in technology that leverages his efforts and produces the best results for his clients. When listing a home, this technology is a key component in his 21-point approach to providing maximum exposure to reach interested buyers.

Moe is not just in the business of real estate - he brings people together. Over 30 years he has developed strong network of trade professionals - such as home inspectors, building/remodeling contractors, plumbers, electricians, septic companies - as well as professionals to help with financing and acquiring properties for real estate investment. Moe’s connections provide an invaluable resource to both clients and friends.

In 2003, Moe rolled up his sleeves and built his own house in Bedford, New Hampshire. With the help of several contractors, this endeavor took him nine months of working early mornings before going to work and late nights after selling homes to complete. This knowledge enables him to guide clients who are purchasing new construction.

When he’s not working (which isn’t often), Moe can be found grillin’ and chillin’ and his home on Lake Winnipesaukee. He loves a good snowstorm because it means that nobody is out looking at homes, and he can head up to the slopes for a day of skiing. Once a year he can be found on the big slopes in Colorado, Utah, and most recently Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

New Hampshire,NH,2020.0,English,agent,"As a Realtor in the top 3% of all NH Realtors, my goal is to consistently exceed client expectations and provide unsurpassed customer service. I work with buyers and sellers specializing in residential, relocation, commercial, multi-family, land, new construction, and first-time home buying. I strive to provide the best response time in the industry while empowering my clients with key information needed to make vital decisions. If you are considering a real estate goal in 2024 I would be honored if you would consider working with me to accomplish it.

If you have partnered with different Realtors before you probably noticed that the experiences were not the same. The ability to provide exceptional customer service while having cutting-edge market knowledge and superb communication skills are qualities of the best in the field. My goal is to provide a 5-star experience with every person I work with. It's a goal that anyone can shoot for but what sets me apart is that I have been developing the skills to make this goal possible for twenty-eight years. In that time I have worked in numerous service positions culminating in a fourteen-year nursing career and now as a Realtor. I have had the privilege to work with people from around the world and from all walks of life. Additionally, last year alone, I worked with fifty-six clients and have received only 5-star reviews. I'd love to provide you with such customer service too.

I am a New Hampshire native who moved to Concord while attending NHTI and working at Concord Hospital. My wife and I have been married for eleven years and share our home with four dogs. I am a churchgoer, a motorcycle rider, and a sports enthusiast. I love everything outdoors, especially travel, and have visited 5 continents and over 25 countries to date. Giving back to the community is important to me and I've assisted at the New Hampshire Food Bank and with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program.

New Jersey,NJ,2007.0,English,agent,"The primary goal of The Josh Behr Group is to guide our clients through the exciting step by step journey to and from home-ownership! Whether you're selling, buying, or investing in today's challenging marketplace, our objective is provide the highest level service, professionalism, and more importantly, results! Knowing that there are so many agents in the marketplace that rely on old fashioned & passive techniques when selling real estate, Josh Behr continues to focus on using the latest technology available to assist our clients in both the purchase and sale of a home. What separates Josh from his competition is his hungry and drive to continue to learn. He's hyper-focused on education, not only for himself but for his team. ""He gets after it"" is a common term his past clients use when describing how he gets their homes sold so quickly. Josh actively prospects 3 hours a day looking for buyers for his sellers and vice versa. Each member of The Josh Behr Group has a deep commitment to ethical integrity. They work with their clients to find out their true needs and wants, and find the best solutions for them. They save sales other agents would let slip away, and stop sales that aren't in the best interests of their clients, even if it means losing the sale! It's not all work and no play. When Josh is out of the office, he loves seeing the world with wife and two kids. And by world, I'm pretty much just talking about Disney. They are Disney Fanatics!!! Josh also enjoys running, playing basketball, and is a huge Philly Sports Fan!

Which can be a very happy moment and also for some can be a ""bitter sweet"" moment. I have developed many friendships over the years with my customers, that go beyond the closing table, and that is the best reward at the end of a contract!""

New Mexico,NM,2009.0,,agent,"I was born and raised in El Paso and attended Coronado High School and Angelo State University, where I played Fast Pitch Softball. I was a Personal Trainer for 9 years prior to becoming a full-time realtor, so I understand that every one has different needs in order to fulfill their goals. 

As an agent who's an expert in this local area, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise about buying and selling real estate here. It's not the same everywhere, so you need someone you can trust for up-to-date information. I am eager to serve you. Here are some of the things I can do for you:

Find Your Next Home
You need someone who knows this area inside and out! I can work with you to find the right home at the right price for you, including all the neighborhood amenities that matter - not to mention the essential criteria you have for your ideal home

Sell a Home
When it's time to move, you need someone who will advertise your home, show to prospective buyers, negotiate the purchase contract, arrange financing, oversee the inspections, handle all necessary paperwork and supervise the closing. I can take care of everything you need, from start to close.

Craig Zager is the most sought-after Realtor in the Lake Tahoe Basin. He has been an East Shore property specialist since 1989 with a loyal following from serving over 1000 clients over the past 30 years. His impeccable reputation as a tenacious advocate, experienced investment advisor, and skilled negotiator has earned him the title of no.1 agent for Coldwell Banker in the State of Nevada since 2010. Craig has successfully negotiated over 1 billion dollars in sales ranging from quant ski condos to luxury lakefront estates. He consistently ranks among the top Coldwell Banker agents in North America, selling more properties from Stateline to Glenbrook (East Shore Lake Tahoe, NV), than any other agent (area 650, NNRMLS). In 2020, Craig formed the Zager Group, a skilled team of agents who have continued to uphold his level of service and expertise. The Zager Group has earned no.1 small team in all of Nevada from the national real estate reporting firm, Real Trends for the last 2 years. 

“Craig was a true professional in every respect. He listened attentively to our needs and was extremely responsive to our questions throughout the entire process. Craig demonstrated a deep knowledge of the Lake Tahoe market and was extremely helpful in guiding us through the details of the various neighborhoods we viewed. He continued to care for our needs up to and after the close, directing us to reputable service providers and tradespeople. We highly recommend Craig and his team.”

Soon after high school, he bought a one-way ticket from his Los Angeles hometown suburb, to Lake Tahoe — he has never looked back. Like the majority of people, Zager was drawn to the area because of his love for the outdoors. “My passion and in-depth knowledge of Lake Tahoe from 30+ years of building a local business and raising a family here, have helped me to be the trusted resource that my friends and clients lean on.”   

A Certified Residential Specialist, Certified Luxury Home Marketing Specialist, Resort and Second Home Property Specialist, and certified E-PRO, Zager is passionate about real estate education and is continually increasing his knowledge of the real estate industry. Craig is not only an experienced financial planner but has extensive knowledge in real estate investing and strongly believes that real estate is one of the surest and safest avenues for generating wealth.

Integrity, tenacity, superior knowledge and authenticity have been the foundation of building his business for the past 30 years. “Real estate comes down to relationships and relationships are built on trust. I am passionately committed to each one of my clients, whether it be a first-time home buyer, seller, or an experienced investor. I have a thorough understanding of our local market conditions and the forces that shape them and work to earn every client’s business and trust.”",9,http://www.CBselectRE.com,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/a760413acb0ec58ee2af6f6ebc0b9784o-c778687200o.jpg,,,,4569670,Coldwell Banker Select Real Estate,Visit Our Web Site-No Pops-No Ads-Have Fun.,"89701, 89706, 89703, 89413, 89702, 89712, 89711, 89714, 89713, 89721, 96150, 96151, 96152, 96154, 96155, 96156, 96157",Agent,True,64423,False,,5.0,http://www.craigzager.com/,5673dcfc89a689010069d5bd,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:40:13 GMT",agent,USA,ZEPHYR COVE,188 Highway 50,,89448,NV,PO BOX 10829,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/cfb1d49c6baad59ae2d2ab206f037510a-e483220767s.jpg,False,,Craig Zager,107994273,#142f54,,COLDWELL BANKER SELECT REAL ESTATE,https://ap.rdcpix.com/abcd5bb7896fe1d1f33b9d997e3812d3k-c3832528067s.jpg,,,975046,10,"seller, buyer",True,0.0,CRAIG ZAGER,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Craig-Zager_ZEPHYR-COVE_NV_64423_107994273,,3807265,"Craig Zager, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/28a34b273cc247ce71b5018eede3f3ccg-c966463500s.jpg,One of Lake Tahoe's Natural Resources,True,,,2025-10-09T06:38:47Z,395000,13300000,25,410000,16025000,2025-09-26,48,True,4380962.0,450253139.0,CRAIG,ZAGER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Carson City_NV, Mound House_NV, Glenbrook_NV, Lakeridge_NV, Logan Creek_NV, Skyland_NV, South Lake Tahoe_CA, Meyers_CA, Fallen Leaf_CA, Zephyr Cove_NV, Stateline_NV, Incline Village_NV","Carson City_NV, Glenbrook_NV, South Lake Tahoe_CA, Zephyr Cove, Stateline, Incline Village, Carson Valley","Buyer's agent, Seller's agent","CRS, EPRO, RSPS",FAR_203C1EAF,S.23628,"FAR_1CBB1EAF, FAR_203C1EAF","S.0023628, S.23628",,,,,,,,"188 Highway 50, PO BOX 10829, ZEPHYR COVE, NV 89448, USA",(775) 588-4531,Office,(775) 588-4531 (Office),,,(775) 901-4663,Mobile,(775) 901-4663,(775) 901-4663 (Mobile)

I am able to provide a unique perspective, as I have a strong knowledge base around the monetary investment in buying a home with my CPA experience, yet I have learned and developed the skills that come with working in real estate since I was young enough to remember!

New York,NY,2015.0,,agent,"With roots long and deep, connecting her to Penn Yan and Keuka Lake, Mary Worth has signed on with Nothnagle, REALTORS® Hometown Choice, with the goal of bringing people home to this wonderful location.Mary was born and raised on Keuka Lake and then in the Village of Penn Yan, giving her the best of all worlds. Raising two daughters in Connecticut, Pittsford and New York City with summers on Keuka Lake brought the balance they all loved.  After launching children, she went on to live in Boston, New Jersey, Ft. Lauderdale, and finally, permanently, Keuka Lake.  “Trust me, I know what it means to move a family.  We have been fortunate enough to live in some wonderful places, but it is always such a relief to come home to the Finger Lakes.  There’s no place like it on earth” said Mary.  “We have bought and sold and rented more homes than most.  No wonder real estate is my passion!” Mary began her career in Broadcasting working for the CBS News Division in the Broadcast Center on West 57th Street in New York City.  She later went on to become a writer, reporter, producer, and eventually, news and programming promotion manager. While raising children, Mary was involved in Girl Scouts, tutoring in the inner city, religious education, promotion for St. Louis School in Pittsford, and freelance projects for the OCD Foundation.",0,http://www.howardhanna.com/Office/Detail/Penn%20Yan/004657,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/348be37bdabb19d4c8103c89a73a4ea1g-c3939720492s.jpg,,,,3256028,Howard Hanna - Penn Yan - Howard Hanna Lake Group,,"14456, 14512, 14527, 14810, 14840",Agent,True,2060120,False,,0.0,http://maryworth.howardhanna.com,567441a20fa41701007214c9,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 07:06:01 GMT",agent,USA,Penn Yan,229 Lake Street,NY,14527,NY,,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/e81919d088eb55acf2b13f4ff871e504a-w2632370950s.jpg,,,Mary Worth,440384163,#0c653a,,Howard Hanna Real Estate - Broker,https://ap.rdcpix.com/3e66f97a0296ae161f3d5fa887a50351k-c1618743321s.jpg,True,https://www.youtube.com/embed/iEl_Razw-Lo?modestbranding=1&rel=0,1535106,13,"buyer, seller",True,4.0,Mary Worth,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Mary-Worth_Penn-Yan_NY_2060120_440384163,,218260153,"Mary Worth, Agent",1,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/g586f1f00-c0od-w1200_q50.jpg,Working in YOUR best interest!,False,,,2025-10-09T12:58:47Z,167900,1260000,8,224900,1749889,2025-10-01,41,False,,425004180.0,Mary,Worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hall_NY, Fayette_NY, Geneva_NY, Springwater_NY, Naples_NY, Middlesex_NY, Penn Yan_NY, Keuka Park_NY, Veterans Administration_NY, Bath_NY, Cameron_NY, Kanona_NY, Hammondsport_NY, Pulteney_NY, Wayne_NY","Geneva_NY, Naples_NY, Penn Yan_NY, Bath_NY, Hammondsport_NY","Lakefront Property, Keuka Lake, Seneca Lake, Canandaigua Lake, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_19FE1EB2,10401274175,FAR_19FE1EB2,10401274175,FAR_19FE1EB2,,FAR_19FE1EB2,,"FAR_1E431F62|10401274175|inactive=2024-06-01T13:49:19.000Z, FAR_221E1EB2|10401274175|inactive=2024-06-01T11:57:45.000Z, FAR_1A551EB2|10401274175|inactive=2024-05-31T23:43:44.000Z, FAR_21691EB2|10401274175|inactive=2024-05-31T16:05:30.000Z, FAR_20A61EB2|10401274175|inactive=2024-05-31T02:48:57.000Z, FAR_20381EB2|10401274175|inactive=2024-05-30T20:01:45.000Z, FAR_1A5C1EB2|10401274175|inactive=2024-05-30T09:15:02.000Z",FAR_1E431F62,2024-06-01T13:49:19.000Z,"229 Lake Street, <NA>, Penn Yan, NY 14527, USA",(315) 536-2700,Office,(315) 536-2700 (Office),,,(585) 704-4872,Mobile,"(315) 536-2700, (585) 704-4872","(315) 536-2700 (Office), (585) 704-4872 (Mobile)"

I pride myself on being honest, trustworthy, dependable, and knowledgeable in the real estate market. I know how important it is to find your dream home or get the best offer for your property.      Therefore, I will make it my responsibility to help you achieve those goals.

Ohio,OH,2009.0,,agent,"There's nothing like the feeling of walking into a home for the first time and knowing it's ""the one"" or getting a signed contract on your house when you knew it wouldn't sell. As a 27-year Air Force spouse and real estate investor, I've been in both positions many times and love sharing those moments with others. Whether you're a local family looking for a new place to call home or a military family moving in or out of the Dayton area, I'm committed to making your home buying/selling experience stress-free and enjoyable. Real estate isn't something I do to earn a living, it's my passion! I felt the first ""sparks"" when I was just 6 years old, riding in the backseat of a realtor's car and helping my parents search for the perfect 4-bedroom house. By the time I was 12, I had become an amateur appraiser - cruising neighborhoods with my dad, guessing how much the houses cost, and perusing the Dayton Daily to find the correct answers. As an adult, I gained much real estate experience through military moves to New Mexico, Arizona, Virginia, and Alabama. I was finally able to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a realtor when I was licensed in 2009.  It's as if everything I'd done leading up to that point was preparing me for this business.  I not only have years of personal real estate experience but also a B.S. in Mass Communication from Miami University.

Oklahoma,OK,2002.0,,agent,"Hello. My name is Randy Hayes, and I'm the broker for Hayes Realty Group. I help sellers sell their for sale by owner homes in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa Metro Areas, and the entire DFW Metroplex by offering my $269 flat fee MLS/Realtor.com listing program. It is super important to have your home listed on the MLS if you are trying to sell it, which I realized way back before I ever became a realtor or a broker. In fact, MLS listed properties sell for an average of 16% more than for sale by owner homes that don't have the benefit of being on the MLS (due to the fact that about 95% of homes sell from the MLS, which is the realtor's database). 

My brokerage specializes in helping owners of for sale by owner homes sell without throwing away 6% of their hard-earned equity to a realtor that does so little to earn it. In fact, the main difference between myself and a 6% agent is that I charge so little (and that my average seller saves over $5000 in equity as compared to selling using a 6% agent).  The reason that most sellers don't use the flat fee option is that they are unaware that it exists.  

Furthermore, most 6% agents have to pay at least half of their commission to their broker, and are also obligated to pay desk fees and other expenses.  What ends up happening is that most of them are unable to compete with my service or my price legitimately.  In fact, many resort to misinformation and misrepresentation.  I am my own broker, and have virtually none of the overhead that causes 6% agents to overcharge for their service.  I never make another dime after you have paid your $269 MLS listing fee, and you don't pay me that until your listing is live and online. In a nutshell, this is what your $269 gets you:

1) I put your home listing on the MLS, Realtor.com, and about 57 other real estate websites,

2) I put 12 photos on the MLS for you,

3) If a buyer's agent doesn't want to work directly with you, I review and forward offers to you, 

4) I assist you with counter-offers,

5) If the buyer is unrepresented by an agent and you need assistance, I help you with writing the purchase contract,

6) I provide comp reports for you if you need them to assist you with your home pricing, 

7) I answer any other questions that you have about the sales process going forward,

8) I provide you a lockbox for your door, if you'd like to use one,

9) I get your listing up and active within 24-36 hours of receiving your documents back from you, and provide timely listing changes,

10) I have an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, and work hard during the entire process to serve you with honesty and integrity.

My sales using my flat fee listing program number 658, as or 11/20/2014. You can verify the legitimacy of me and my service by going to the real estate commission website, and through the Better Business Bureau. I never take payment until your listing is active on the MLS and you've had a chance to verify your listing online, and have no hidden charges or fees.  Thanks for your consideration.  I'd truly appreciate the opportunity to assist you.  

Sincerely,

Randy Hayes, BA, MEd, Broker #0502970(TX); #153695(OK)

Oklahoma,OK,2020.0,,agent,"Born and Raised in Southern Oklahoma, I bring a deep understanding of the Oklahoma Standard, a strong connection to the local community and a lifelong passion for helping others to my real estate career. I have spent the majority of my adult life in the Norman and Edmond areas, and the last five building a reputation as a trustworthy, client-focused Realtor, dedicated to making the buying and selling process smooth, informed and successful.

I have spent 15 years as an Athletic Trainer, primarily at the collegiate level and more recently in high school athletics. This experience has sharpened my ability to stay calm under pressure, communicate effectively, and lead with integrity.

I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Oklahoma and my Masters degree from the University of Central Oklahoma.

I firmly believe that real estate is more than just a transaction, but about relationships. Whether guiding first-time homebuyers, seasoned investors, or growing families looking for their next chapter, I am committed to providing honest advice, dependable service, and results that exceed expectations.

Outside of real estate, I enjoy spending quality time with family, watching my kids grow and fitting in the occasional round of golf. My grounded, people-first approach is what makes me not just a reliable agent, but a trusted advisor and advocate in your home-buying journey.",0,,,,,,,0,Copper Creek Real Estate,,"73044, 73007, 73034",Agent,True,100306456,False,,0.0,http://ross-mcculloh.ccsellsokc.com/,650b3eaa1b25ff772b68281b,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:58:17 GMT",agent,,,,,,,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/cf80f806da3bc731be415bb04f7d9529a-e2766818088s.jpg,False,,Ross McCulloh,683089603,transparent,,Copper Creek Real Estate Brokers,,,,0,0,"buyer, seller",True,8.0,Ross McCulloh,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Ross-McCulloh___100306456_683089603,,512481675,"Ross McCulloh, Agent",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/ad2d6ebecbd43c2bfe960da7535a1720g-c1075269640s.jpg,,False,,,2025-10-09T05:33:48Z,399900,482500,2,165000,529000,2025-02-27,8,False,,533856444.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cedar Valley_OK, Guthrie_OK, Seward_OK, Langston_OK, Arcadia_OK, Edmond_OK","Guthrie_OK, Arcadia_OK, Edmond_OK",,,FAR_1F081F08,184738,FAR_1F081F08,184738,FAR_1F081F08,,FAR_1F081F08,,,,,<NA>,(405) 888-9902,Mobile,(405) 888-9902 (Mobile),,,,,,

Oregon,OR,2001.0,,agent,"I found my love for real estate in 2001 when I first became licensed in Arizona, where I gained extensive knowledge and experience as a licensed assistant to a top-producing broker in Scottsdale. I soon realized that although my license is in real estate sales, my true profession is creating a memorable, stress-free experience for my clients as they buy or sell their home.
 
My family and I moved to the beautiful Rogue Valley in 2005, and I became licensed to sell real estate in Oregon so I could continue helping buyers and sellers meet their real estate goals. As an owner and Principal Broker of Top Agents Real Estate Company, I also supervise transactions and provide support to the brokers in our firm so they can help their clients reach their goals as well. 

Always striving to educate myself so I can better serve my clients, I have earned the Seller Representative Specialist (SRS) designation, the Commitment to Excellence (C2EX) endorsement, as well as several certifications including Digital Lead Generation Professional, Certified Real Estate Negotiator (CREN), Broker Price Opinion Resource (BPOR), e-Pro, Short Sales & Foreclosure Resource (SFRS), and Military Relocation Professional (MRP). 

I'm a mom of 2 great kids, and we love living in the Rogue Valley with its wide variety of outdoor activities, great local eateries, breweries, wineries, and arts & entertainment options. Some of my favorite things to do in Southern Oregon include hiking RoxyAnn and the Table Rocks, rafting the Rogue River, paddleboarding Applegate Lake, day trips to the coast, concerts at The Britt, snowshoeing, and snowboarding. Regardless of my activities, my clients are a top priority, so my trusty laptop is always on standby, and you can count on me to be responsive to requests, questions, and inquiries, whether it's by call, text, or email. 

Real estate is my passion, and I couldn't imagine a more satisfying career than being able to support, advise, and build relationships with my clients throughout one of the biggest transitions in their lives. I'm excited for the opportunity to be a resource for you as you navigate the home buying or selling process, and look forward to connecting with you!",4,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/55cdfc500690803cb1675ebd3ce9d7b9o-c4017254181o.jpg,,,120794392.0,100206257,Top Agents Real Estate Company,,"97501, 97502, 97504, 97520, 97524, 97530, 97540",Broker/Owner,True,1085153,False,,5.0,https://www.shellsellzoregon.com,56cb8a0cbb954c01006d5e5a,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:13:16 GMT",agent,USA,MEDFORD,5995 HILLCREST RD,,97504,OR,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/2a60a08a1065481f79526e7f43f750f3a-e394121780s.jpg,False,,Rushell Wood,559489558,Transparent,,Top Agents Real Estate Company - Broker,https://ap.rdcpix.com/782dcf42f114b2318c931699b5230c7dk-c2276286469s.jpg,True,,100206254,2,"buyer, seller",True,9.0,Rushell Wood,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Rushell-Wood_MEDFORD_OR_1085153_559489558,Shell,3177849,"Rushell Wood, Broker/Owner",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/74664f64f2c9734f85901cc9d534c3dag-c3731581590s.jpg,Helping you make your next move,True,Hi [client_name]!

Oregon,OR,0.0,,agent,"Anna Cruz is a lifelong Oregonian.
Among her most cherished childhood memories are the exhilaration and awe she felt exploring the Oregon Coast. From her father, she also learned the personal and financial growth opportunities in real estate investment. Her dream destination became a reality in 1998 when she decided to sell her Portland-based floral design business and settle on the south coast.
Buying property changed Anna's life. As a realtor, she is attentive to the same life-changing potential for her clients, and she advocates for timely, successful purchase or sales opportunities. 
Open, prompt communication helps her stay attuned to clients' needs. Her thorough market research ensures sellers' pricing and marketing plans reflect the unique character of each listing. And she helps buyers utilize market data to negotiate their best purchase options.
Anna’s personal and professional experiences benefit clients as they explore the region. She created a homestead in Langlois where she built a home and raised everything from farm animals to flowers, not to mention two incredible children. While building her home and farm, she acquired a wealth of knowledge about rural property development.
Anna enjoys cultivating a diverse network of social and professional connections. She has operated a landscaping business and an artisan pasta and ravioli company, sourcing ingredients from area farmers. She served as an administrative assistant at the Wilderland Montessori School in Langlois and worked as a substitute instructional assistant for 2CJ Port Orford-Langlois schools. As a founding board member for the Port Orford Community Co-op, Anna helped craft the co-op mission and business plan. The co-op opened in 2013 and continues to thrive, providing a market for local food producers while offering healthful, sustainable grocery choices for residents and visitors. 
At Beach Loop Realty, Anna is excited to work alongside expert real estate professionals in a woman-owned business led by Gina Morelli.

Oregon,OR,1993.0,,agent,"I was raised in Oregon, as a native Oregonian I have a particular understanding of the distinctiveness of buying and selling property in the Portland, Lake Oswego, West Linn, Damascus, East Clackamas, and Multnomah counties. I am an active part of the community I live in , and I recognize each areas unique demand.  
Whether buying or selling a home, land or investment property, I will use my experience and skill to make sure the deal is done flawlessly. 

A real estate transaction is more than just buying or selling a property and getting an offer accepted - it’s about attention to the details: schrewed negotiating, understanding loan practices, strong marketing and meeting deadlines.


After obtaining my college degree, I worked as a licensed real estate agent alongside Northern California’s top real estate agents, in estate properties for 8 years helping facilitate over $40 million per year in real estate transactions. Moving back to my home state of Oregon, I continued as a real estate agent for another 2 years. In addition to my real estate background, I had the pleasure of working more than 5 years in the marketing department at Columbia Sportswear. Prior to returning to real estate in 2013, I owned and successfully operated my own business, while raising our two daughters with my husband Craig.
I understand that selling and buying a home is one of the most important financial decisions a person will make in their lifetime. I work 7 days a week to ensure that my clients will receive the best possible customer service. I thoroughly know the counties, the schools and the communities.

Oregon,OR,2021.0,English,agent,"One of the greatest advantages of having a local Real Estate Broker is their knowledge of the community and all that it entails. Being raised in Southern Oregon, Kaila’s family roots run four generations deep, so to say that she knows and loves this community is an understatement. Kaila is a wife and mother to four beautiful children while also an active community member who prides herself on dedication, communication, and loyalty. She comes with a diverse background of experience with companies like Dutch Bros, Grants Pass School District 7 and ROE Motors, which has taught her over the years how to adapt and overcome situations of varying magnitude. 

Kaila often spends her free time in the gorgeous Applegate Valley enjoying some wine tasting or ripping down the Rogue River on a jetboat with her kids and Boatnik Champion Hydroplane Racer husband, Jesse. Fun fact: Some of the property formally known as the “All Sports Park” was owned by Kaila’s great grandparents, which Jesse’s Grandpa had a vision for and has since been made into what is now known as Reinhart Volunteer Park. Available to the Grants Pass Community, this large park runs along the Rogue River and features numerous sports fields, ponds, walking trails, wildlife viewing areas and much more.

If you need a dedicated, knowledgeable REALTOR® you can trust, then look no further because Kaila is a one stop shop for all your Real Estate needs.",0,IDEALBROKERSINC.COM,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/5dce0d1a5d6755151009fc98b52524ado-b2274465705s.jpg,,,,2977721,RE MAX Integrity,,"97526, 97527, 97532, 97497, 97523, 97501, 97503",Broker,True,4067783,False,,0.0,https://kaila-reinhart.remax.com,5eda3007c4f9e90011048d99,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:57:56 GMT",agent,US,Grants Pass,1830 NE 7th Street,,97526,OR,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/8f3837c401b28a14d3e0144c1f52f338a-e3649926496s.jpg,False,,Kaila Reinhart,426194392,Transparent,,"RE/MAX Ideal Brokers, Inc.",,,,3493246,0,"buyer, seller",True,8.0,Kaila Reinhart,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Kaila-Reinhart_Grants-Pass_OR_4067783_426194392,,508094890,"Kaila Reinhart, Broker",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/9a0d5d0d108cae72b066e4dac548c3d4g-c3762466787s.jpg,,False,,,2025-10-09T04:54:32Z,115000,940000,8,19000,875000,2025-09-19,45,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Merlin_OR, Grants Pass_OR, Murphy_OR, New Hope_OR, Redwood_OR, Rogue River_OR, Wolf Creek_OR, Takilma_OR, Cave Junction_OR, O'Brien_OR, Medford_OR, White City_OR","Grants Pass_OR, Merlin_OR, Wolf Creek_OR, Cave Junction_OR, Medford_OR, White City_OR, Jackson & Josephine Counties","First Time Home Buyers, Rural Acreage Properties, Riverfront Properties, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",CRS,FAR_1F011F0F,201242311,"FAR_1F011F0F, FAR_202E1E4D",201242311,FAR_1F731F0F,,"FAR_1F011F0F, FAR_1F731F0F, FAR_202E1E4D",,FAR_203F1F0F|201242311.0|inactive=2024-07-24T06:47:53.000Z,FAR_203F1F0F,2024-07-24T06:47:53.000Z,"1830 NE 7th Street, <NA>, Grants Pass, OR 97526, US",(541) 955-8483,Office,(541) 955-8483 (Office),,,(541) 660-4377,Mobile,(541) 660-4377,"(541) 660-4377 (Office), (541) 660-4377 (Mobile)"

My name is Amanda (McNulty) Vachris. I am a Pennsylvania and Delaware Realtor. I also have a bachelors degree in Marketing from East Stroudsburg University. Real Estate has been a passion of mine for quite some time. When I was younger, I grew up watching my father renovate houses for a living.

I represent my clients with their best interest in mind and making sure the process goes smoothly for them. I will work my hardest to find you that ""dream home"" or a buyer for your current residence.  I would love to help with anything you may need, buying or selling, I will be here to help!

Pennsylvania,PA,2009.0,,agent,"In 2022 the Julie Hess Team helped their 500th family make a move! 

Julie Hess has an all- star team of Agents, Lenders, Title Company, Home Inspectors and other professionals who are ready to assist you through your buying and selling process with a high level of service and professionalism.

Growing up in Central PA Julie learned at an early age what it takes to build a sales career. At age 10, she would go from door to door selling homemade door stoppers in the Harrisburg area, and then selling Avon during high school to earn extra money. Working directly with the customer one on one, she learned the importance of the listening skills needed to understand the client’s needs and build the customer relationships.

Developing an early enthusiasm for selling, the skills she learned lead her into a successful sales career, selling fine art for 12 years. In this career she once again continued to develop her passion for selling, developing customer relationships, and providing top notch service. She would hold art shows in the homes of her clients throughout all of Central Pa. This not only gave her the knowledge of the Harrisburg area, but of all the surrounding areas, their neighborhoods, new developments, schools and lifestyles.  

After leaving the art business, Julie wanted to gain more experience in marketing and advertising. To gain this experience, she started working with Clipper Magazine focusing on regional and national sales and helping businesses grow their sales and revenue through advertising.

Rhode Island,RI,2008.0,,agent,"I live in Newport County, RI with my husband and four active children. I have lived here for 30 years, and am very connected to the community. I enjoy attending my kids’ many sporting events, volunteering at school, and relaxing at the beach. “The Island,” as the locals call it, has really become my dream home.

Throughout the years, I have thoroughly enjoyed raising my family here, while buying and selling both commercial and residential properties. Becoming a realtor allows me to pursue two of my passions- real estate and helping people.

Since I live and work in the same community, I understand the current market here in Rhode Island. I also belong to a large network of professionals who can assist before and after the home purchase.

South Carolina,SC,2006.0,,agent,"I love Charlotte, Real Estate and your needs come first!!   

Charlotte is a fantastic city!  It has everything from great people, attractive job market, affordable living, education, great food, culture, and weather.  We are close to both the mountains and the beach, not to mention the local lakes such as Lake Norman, Lake Wylie, Tega Cay and Mountain Isle Lake. We have sports too. Of course the Carolina Panthers, Charlotte Hornets, Knight Baseball, Nascar, golf and so much more. The Queen City really does make for great living!! 

As a real estate professional since 2006, I have extensive experience and knowledge of the always changing Charlotte area market. Finding the right home for you and walking you through the process is what matters most. 

My husband Matt and I are veterans of the US Air Force and have made several cross country moves in our 37+ years together so I certainly understand the challenges of large and small moves. 

To me, being a Realtor means honesty, professionalism, knowledge and taking care of my clients first and foremost.  I have been so blessed to have met and worked with so many wonderful people over the years. Many have become friends and I cherish those relationships. This is not about helping once but truly being a trusted resource when you need anything along the way.  

Matt and I have a son Zach who served in the US Army and now lives in California. Our fur-baby Gili, a German Shorthair pointer is spoiled rotten and we have a flock of laying hens. Yes, I am a chicken lady! :-) 

I love spending time with family & friends and I love to QUILT!! Baking, crafting and home reno shows are other passion I enjoy!! 😁

South Carolina,SC,2018.0,,agent,"You could say that real estate is the bedrock of the Phillips Carter family! Anne, the daughter of Martin and Anne who’s known as “Annie” to her family, is proud to be a new member of the Martin Phillips Properties team. In addition to listing and selling properties, Anne also oversees marketing and transaction coordination for the team.

Growing up in the business, Annie learned the basics from her parents, bringing an innovative, vibrant, and youthful energy to the team. She is tech-savvy and confident, using the most cutting-edge technological developments to help buyers streamline the search process for their dream home, and leverages those same techniques to create sophisticated marketing strategies for sellers.

Annie recently earned The Institute for Luxury Home Marketing’s Million Dollar GUILD™ recognition for experience, knowledge, and expertise in million-dollar and above residential properties. She is a Certified Luxury Home Marketing Specialist™ (CLHMS), an exclusive group of real estate professionals who have completed The Institute’s training and proven performance in the upper-tier market. Agents who have earned the CLHMS designation are known for performing at the highest level in their community.

Becoming a real estate agent felt like the natural next step for Annie. Her passion started young, as she often joined her mom on trips to open houses. Annie knew she could provide clients with a seamless and satisfying experience as a good listener, effective communicator, and generally charismatic person. Five things you can count on from Anne Phillips Carter: integrity, hard work, commitment, passion, and kindness.

Annie was born and raised in South Carolina but has always felt that Pawley Island was her true home. She spent summers in this beautiful location, where her mother and grandparents before her were also raised. Having spent so much time in the area, Annie is an expert on the best neighborhoods and properties, especially within the Waccamaw Neck and the island’s luxurious oceanfront, golf, and retirement communities. 

When Annie isn’t busy with real estate, she loves spending time with her three amazing daughters, going to the beach, playing tennis, and reading. She is also an active and committed member of The Abbey Church.

South Carolina,SC,2017.0,,agent,"Ellis Grossman, a Charleston native, started his professional career in the restaurant business. While this was not his original plan, he realized he had a passion for the restaurant business, particularly in obtaining real estate and making a profitable enterprise.
Ellis attended the Culinary Institute of Charleston at Trident Technical College. After earning his degree in culinary arts and business technology, Ellis chose to take a different approach than most and jumped directly into the fast food industry. He was Director of Operations for Bojangles and later Vice President, while also serving as Chairman of the Board at the Culinary Institute of Charleston where he also taught culinary classes.
In 2010, inspired by the need to bring healthy ingredients to the fast food business, Ellis started Black Bean Co. Ellis carried his love of fresh ingredients directly into Black Bean Co.’s overall mission. While operating five restaurants, Ellis was farming 35 acres of land. He sold his harvest to many restaurants in Charleston with the help of Limehouse Produce. Whether it be ingredients made fresh daily, compostable packaging, or the green decor, Ellis finds that it’s important to extend his knowledge and experience of what sustainability can truly be.
After Black Bean Co., Ellis wanted to continue his mission of helping people in a new industry. In 2017, Ellis chose the path of Real Estate with a mission to help members of the community with their current real estate needs, but more importantly, their real estate investment goals of the future. Ellis seeks to build lifetime relationships and give the highest rated service to all of his clients, customers, vendors and the people within the community.

As your Realtor, I'm passionate about helping you with your home needs and making it not just a business transaction, but an adventure that will make the process memorable.

Knowing that I helped you find the home where you begin the life you dreamed of, whether it be starting a family, being a crazy cat lady, living single with just a dog or 10, starting a home-based business, or any other dream you have, is rewarding to me. I love hearing the stories that begin with me, and continue with you, and I enjoy being a part of that. It doesn't get any groovier than that.

I know how to get the job done professionally and sometimes unconventionally, but done, nonetheless.

On a personal note, I am a proud parent and grandmother. I enjoy road trips, comedy, healthy eating, Krispy Creme (I know, I know), riding motorcycles, kayaking, hiking, camping, jumping out of planes, and DIY projects. 
I also enjoy holding hands and long walks on the...wait...wrong bio.
I hope that you'll choose me to be your Realtor.",0,FathomRealty.com,,,,,914979742.0,3871291,FATHOM REALTY ,,29607,Agent,True,2265852,False,,0.0,https://anitabrown.fathomrealty.com/,571a621bc27c990100a98dd4,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:42:21 GMT",agent,USA,GREENVILLE,1200 WOODRUFF RD STE A,,29607,SC,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d02eae4c4ca6e333eb411285cd4ea6f9a-e1418985617s.jpg,False,,Anita Brown,225599252,Transparent,,Fathom Realty,https://ap.rdcpix.com/9440d777440d01b09346fd13d7df5584k-c3071179646s.jpg,,,3628529,1,"buyer, seller",True,3.0,Anita Brown,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Anita-Brown_GREENVILLE_SC_2265852_225599252,,303589264,"Anita Brown, Agent",1,,A real estate experience you'll love...groovy!,False,,,2025-10-09T12:37:48Z,169000,289900,5,45000,475000,2025-10-08,22,False,,,Anita,Brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mauldin_SC, Greenville_SC","Greenville_SC, Greenville County, Laurens county and surrounding areas","first time home buyers, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_1BEF2090,,"FAR_19932090, FAR_1BEF2090",96264,FAR_1BEF2090,,"FAR_19932090, FAR_1BEF2090",,,,,"1200 WOODRUFF RD STE A, <NA>, GREENVILLE, SC 29607, USA",(888) 455-6040,Office,(888) 455-6040 (Office),SC:22780,SC,(864) 354-4190,Mobile,(864) 354-4190,"(864) 354-4190 (Mobile), (864) 354-4190 (Office)"

He was able to answer every question I asked, helped me to coordinate everything I needed to complete the purchase of my new home. I live in CT and when the property I purchased came up, I was unable to get to South Carolina to see the house. Jaime offered to go to the property and take pictures of the place which he then sent to me. He then described the house in detail. He was able to help me through each phase of the process. It was easy to see that he wasn't just interested in making a sale. The house is now mine, and Jaime has continued to assist me in several areas where I needed help. I have purchased two other properties in the past, this has been the best experience I have had.

Sold a home in 2013.

Jamie was my realtor in the selling of my townhouse and the purchase of my first home. Jamie was very knowledgeable in the current markets and had great information to help educate me on what I needed to do to sell and buy fast. Jamie was easy to get in contact with and always kept me updated on any new market information I should know. His knowledge of the process was very impressive in both selling and buying homes. During my purchase of my new home many issues came up with the seller. Jamie made sure to attack the issues head on and get them solved in a impressive and professional manner. I couldn't imagine anyone doing a better job then Jamie did during both processes. I would recommend him for anyone wanting to sell or buy a home.

Jamie has a very professional approach to finding the right property. He was very helpful in cutting through the ""fog"" of properties. Because of our limited schedule while in the Myrtle Beach area, Jamie always made available time for me

Bought a home in 2013
We knew the area slightly, and Jamie was referred to us. We described what we wanted, what we didn't, he quickly zeroed in on our needs, and found the exact house to fit our specifications in a short period of time. Jamie provided us with local, county and state information which we needed, but hadn't asked for yet. Any phone calls I made to him were returned promptly. We highly recommend you hire Jamie D'Anna if you want the job done efficiently.",0,https://palmettocoastalhomes.com/about-us/,,,,,,0,Palmetto Coastal Homes,,"29526, 29575, 29576, 29577, 29582, 29585, 29588",Agent,True,978090,False,,0.0,,56c9d0bc89a68901006ed053,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 08:17:59 GMT",agent,US,MYRTLE BEACH,4214 MAYFAIR ST STE F,,29577,SC,,,http://p.rdcpix.com/v05/aaaec0e00-c0o.jpg,,,James D'anna,146774742,,,,,,,0,0,"buyer, seller",True,0.0,James D'anna,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/James-D'anna_MYRTLE-BEACH_SC_978090_146774742,,3233174,"James D'anna, Agent",1,,,False,,,2025-10-09T11:26:09Z,325000,525000,2,175000,850000,2025-09-16,34,False,,140716486.0,James,D'anna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Red Hill_SC, Conway_SC, Homewood_SC, Surfside Beach_SC, Garden City_SC, Murrells Inlet_SC, Socastee_SC, Myrtle Beach_SC, Cherry Grove_SC, North Myrtle Beach_SC, Ocean Drive_SC, Atlantic Beach_SC, Pawleys Island_SC, North Litchfield_SC, Litchfield_SC, Litchfield Beach_SC, Forestbrook_SC","Conway_SC, Myrtle Beach_SC, Murrells Inlet_SC, North Myrtle Beach_SC, Pawleys Island_SC","Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_1E372090,70210,FAR_1E372090,70210,FAR_1E372090,,"FAR_1BEF2090, FAR_1E372090",,,,,"4214 MAYFAIR ST STE F, <NA>, MYRTLE BEACH, SC 29577, US",(843) 213-1589,Office,(843) 213-1589 (Office),,,(843) 685-5008,Office,(843) 685-5008,(843) 685-5008 (Office)

South Carolina,SC,2023.0,,agent,"Rebecca and I moved back to our hometown- Florence- in 2006 after spending four great years in Dallas, Texas.  When we moved back we immediately began talking about purchasing rental properties with my sister and brother-in-law.  It was not until 2014 when our talk became reality and each family was able to put 15,000 towards the purchase of two homes.  We purchased two homes in 2014- one for 28,000 and one for 32,000.  Obviously, not much to write home about, but it started a journey that has been a huge blessing to our family!



Since 2014 we have bought and sold several properties-including the two original properties that got us started.  Each family has also gone out on its own to purchase additional rental properties.



All of our properties are located in Florence and we are invested in every residential market Florence has to offer- from short-term nightly rentals and mid-term rentals on our Airbnb / personal booking website to long-term rentals.  We have made plenty of mistakes and also learned a tremendous amount in the last nine years.



After seventeen great years serving a wonderful church and working as a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) it was clear that the stretching, challenging call on my life was to leave the comfortable church job to see what it was like in the ""real world"" as a ""regular old guy.""  So, here I am, with a little experience behind me and a lot of enthusiasm ahead, I am excited to continue to learn and help families reap the benefits of real estate investing- whether that be in your primary home or in building a portfolio of rental properties.

Here’s a closer look at the trends shaping the market:

Rising Home Prices: One of the most significant trends has been the steady increase in home prices. Fueled by high buyer demand and a shortage of available homes, prices have consistently risen year-over-year. This has been particularly pronounced in popular areas, where competition among buyers has driven up prices, often resulting in homes selling at or above the asking price.

Low Inventory Levels: South Dakota has experienced a persistent shortage of housing inventory, creating a strong seller’s market. Fewer homes on the market mean that sellers have the upper hand, with properties selling faster than ever. Many buyers have faced challenges finding available homes, leading to increased competition and multiple-offer situations.

Increased Buyer Demand: The demand for homes in South Dakota has been robust, driven by a combination of factors including historically low interest rates, a desire for more space, and an influx of out-of-state buyers seeking a lower cost of living and quality of life. The pandemic further accelerated these trends, with more people prioritizing homeownership and the flexibility of remote work.

Market Resilience: Despite broader economic uncertainties, the South Dakota real estate market has shown remarkable resilience. Even during periods of economic fluctuation, demand for housing has remained strong, reflecting the state’s appeal as a desirable place to live and invest.

Shifting Buyer Preferences: Buyer preferences have shifted significantly, with increased interest in homes offering more space, both inside and out. Features like home offices, larger lots, and proximity to outdoor amenities have become highly sought after, reflecting lifestyle changes brought about by the pandemic.

Overall, Highly competitive","My marketing strategy for sellers combines both online and offline approaches to maximize exposure and attract the right buyers, ensuring your home sells quickly and for the best possible price. Here’s how I do it:

**Online Marketing:** In today’s digital age, having a strong online presence is crucial. I utilize high-quality professional photography and, if needed, virtual tours or drone footage to showcase your home in the best light. Your property will be listed on major real estate platforms, including the MLS, Zillow, Realtor.com, and social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I leverage targeted digital ads to reach potential buyers based on their location, interests, and online behavior. Additionally, I use email marketing campaigns to reach my network of buyers and other agents to create immediate interest.

**Offline Marketing:** Offline, I employ traditional methods that still hold significant value in real estate. This includes professional yard signage to attract local buyers and open houses to provide personal walkthroughs of your property. I also network extensively within the local community and with other agents to spread the word about your listing. Print marketing, such as high-quality brochures and postcards, is used to reach buyers who prefer tangible information or might not be actively searching online.

**Additional Services and Costs: To enhance your home’s appeal, I offer staging consultations to highlight its best features and suggest minor updates or repairs that can significantly increase its market value. I also provide market analysis and pricing strategies to ensure your home is competitively priced. Most marketing services are included in my standard listing package; however, any additional enhancements, such as professional staging or extensive renovation advice, might incur extra costs, which I’ll discuss transparently upfront.
My goal is to provide a comprehensive marketing approach that covers all bases.",,,,,,,,"Sioux Falls_SD, Renner Corner_SD, Meadow View Addition_SD, Wall Lake_SD, Tea_SD, Crooks_SD, Buffalo Ridge_SD, Harrisburg_SD, Shindler_SD, Pine Lakes Addition_SD, Anderson_SD, Corson_SD, Rowena_SD, Brandon_SD, Lyons_SD, Wellington_SD, Hartford_SD, Baltic_SD, Dell Rapids_SD, Beresford_SD, Spink_SD, Emmet_SD, Lennox_SD, Orland Colony_SD, Montrose_SD, Ramsey_SD, Salem_SD, Golden View Colony_SD","Sioux Falls_SD, Brandon_SD, Harrisburg_SD, Hartford_SD, Crooks_SD, Baltic_SD, Dell Rapids_SD, Beresford_SD, Lennox_SD, Montrose_SD, Salem_SD, North and Southeast South Dakota","Buyer's agent, Seller's agent, Investments, Luxury Listings, Acreages/ Farm Land",,FAR_20932091,,FAR_20932091,,FAR_20932091,,FAR_20932091,,,,,"6300 South Connie Ave., <NA>, SIOUX FALLS, SD 57108, US",(605) 275-0555,Office,(605) 275-0555 (Office),,,(605) 728-6599,Mobile,(605) 728-6599,(605) 728-6599 (Mobile)

My marketing background and broadcast journalism degree have provided me with the tools I need to tell the home's story through pictures, video, virtual tours, and print advertising.  Buyers can browse through lots of pictures and learn the home's ""story"" which might help them narrow their search in less time and get them to the closing table faster.

Tennessee,TN,2017.0,,agent,"Theresa Goolsby, Your Memphis Area Real Estate Agent

I am transplant to the Memphis area, and originally from Birmingham, Alabama. I have lived here for nearly 6 years.  When we made the move to Memphis, it gave me an opportunity to ""reboot"" my life and career. I chose real estate as a new career path, because it allows me to utilize my seventeen year career as a paralegal as well as my sales & marketing experience. I pursued property management initially to ""get my feet wet"" with real estate and before I knew it, I was diving in. I understand that there are many agents out there to choose from, a few things that I feel set me apart are my customer service attitude when it comes to people. I will strive to exceed all my client’s expectations in all aspects of the real estate process and to give them an overall excellent experience every time. In addition, I believe I have an advantage over other agents, as I have been on all sides of the real estate process during my legal career.  This allows me to be able to truly explain all steps of the buying, selling & the closing process. I believe the more you know about this process, the better I can serve you.  I like to set expectations in the beginning and let you know what is happening in your local market and make sure you understand how it can affect the purchase or sale of your home.  This will allow you to make informed choices on the purchase or sale of your home. Lastly, communication is also key in this relationship, so with me as your agent, you will receive constant communication, interaction and feedback. I would love to be a part of this exciting journey of helping you to buy and/or sell your home. My goal is to make everything go as smooth as possible for you and your family, as well as keep your stress level to a minimum.

Texas,TX,2010.0,,agent,"A native Austinite, Elizabeth Adams brings a deeply-rooted knowledge of the Austin community to the Urbanspace Residential team. Having lived in just about every pocket of central Austin, Elizabeth is intimately familiar with each individual neighborhood – and the lifestyle that comes with it.  This wealth of insight has served as a tremendous resource to her long-standing clients in their home search. 

Elizabeth has been selling residential real estate in a multitude of neighborhoods since 2010, when she was awarded the “Rookie of the Year”.  She was recruited to Urbanspace in 2014 to bring her central Austin expertise to the Urbanspace team.  She is committed to being a life- long learner.  Thus the opportunity to add Downtown into her extensive list of mastered neighborhoods was an added incentive for her to join the Urbanspace family.

Elizabeth’s love of Austin is exemplified in the numerous organizations in which she dedicates her time. Adams spearheaded the “Friends of Tarrytown Park” initiative, and is actively involved in the Austin Parks Foundation and the Helping Hand Home for Children.

Her professional associations include the Austin Luxury Network, Real Estate Council of Austin (RECA), Austin Board of Realtors (ABoR), Texas Association of Realtors (TAR), National Association of Realtors (NAR), and Certified Luxury Home Marketing Specialist (CLHMS).

An alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin, Elizabeth’s professional background includes national account management and enterprise marketing for Dell Inc., tradeshow and meeting planning for the National Industrial Transportation League, and political staff positions within U.S. presidential and Texas gubernatorial and Supreme Court Justice campaigns.

When not selling real estate, or parenting, Adams is known for exploring new hobbies and enjoying old ones.  A lifelong runner, Elizabeth’s love of running started on the trails of Lady Bird Lake as a long distance runner on Austin High’s track team. Her latest hobby, studying Spanish, has prompted her to take her family to study in both Costa Rica and Spain.

Elizabeth, and her two daughters recently moved to give high-rise downtown living a try!",0,WWW.URBANSPACEREALTORS.COM,,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/obe4f1600-c0l.gif,,,294699412.0,1462206,Urbanspace,real estate for urban lifestyles,"78703, 78731, 78701",Real Estate Consultant,True,1117378,False,,0.0,https://elizabethadamsrealtor.com,56cc0d987e54f70100239cb3,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 11:30:54 GMT",agent,US,AUSTIN,301 WEST AVE STE 100,,78701,TX,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/744932723/eec20a4b87356aad75da403833a66313a-e0s.jpg,,,Elizabeth Adams,708079412,,,Urbanspace REALTORS -  Broker,,,,4550977,0,"buyer, seller",True,0.0,Elizabeth Adams,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Elizabeth-Adams_AUSTIN_TX_1117378_708079412,,3521468,"Elizabeth Adams, Real Estate Consultant",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/6283524/713186df168161e297529a295d43700cg-c0s.jpg,,False,,,2025-10-09T13:06:44Z,650000,1675000,4,0,0,2025-08-29,14,False,,,Elizabeth,Adams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Austin_TX,Austin_TX,"Central Austin, Westlake, Downtown, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",GRI,FAR_199A2109,0599711,FAR_199A2109,0599711,FAR_199A2109,,"FAR_1C502109, FAR_199A2109",,,,,"301 WEST AVE STE 100, <NA>, AUSTIN, TX 78701, US",(512) 457-8884,Office,(512) 457-8884 (Office),,,(512) 745-1044,Office,(512) 745-1044,(512) 745-1044 (Office)

Texas,TX,2011.0,,agent,"I have been licensed as a Realtor since June 2011, after over 25 years in the legal profession.  My husband, Don, and I bought our first investment property in 2008, and I found I had a passion for real estate and helping others with their real estate needs!  This has been an amazing opportunity to help others go for their dreams in real estate!  We have 3 children, and now 6 grandchildren... they are definitely the icing on the cupcake!  I understand the importance of family and dreams for your family, whether that is selling to purchase your next home, buying your dream home, the farm or ranch you’ve always dreamed of owning, or building an investment portfolio, including commercial investments, to help with raising your family, kids' college expenses, and retirement.My business philosophy: My clients come first. It’s all about you as my client. Funny thing how God takes care of you while you’re taking care of those He brings into your life.  Integrity, Honesty, Loyalty.  We’re all in this for a mutual purpose… someone has a property to sell, and the other has a need to buy.  As my business has grown through the trust of many clients over the years, I have built a team of incredible Realtors to help our clients with their real estate needs.   You will find the same care from each of them as you do from me personally, as they each represent the strongest of work ethics, strive for excellence in everything they do, and go above and beyond to help our clients from the first conversation, through the transaction process, closing, and we're always here for our clients afterward, having built a continuing relationship.  Being in the top 1% of our market for the past 4 years for sales production is an honor as it proves our motto, that when you, as our clients, are successful, then we consider ourselves successful. As a seller, you will find that you are not just another listing, but that we work hard to market and try to sell your property, going above and beyond as necessary to get the job done. It’s important that your property is well advertised, reaching as many people as possible, locally and nationally, and that it is well-kept so it will make a great first impression on Buyers as they view it as their potential next home.

Texas,TX,2018.0,,agent,"""You're in the right pLACE""
I have been a licensed agent for six years. I specialize in residential & commercial and will go above and beyond for my clients! I love working with investors and first-time home buyers! I know all the local restaurants because I take my family to them. I know all the local businesses because I want to keep my money local. My husband also owns a small business, so I know the importance firsthand. I know all the schools because I attended them as have my three children. My sphere is huge between my husband owning a business and our three children participating in sports and extra-curricular activities for almost 20 years! I wasn't born in Texas, but got here as quickly as I could! Some may call me the Queen of East Texas and working with me, you're ALWAYS in the right pLACE!

Utah,UT,0.0,,agent,"Born and raised in Utahâ€™s Salt Lake Valley, Kristy Owens is an accomplished real estate broker who offers her clients a proven combinationâ€”local knowledge paired with a comprehensive understanding of todayâ€™s evolving housing market. Kristy graduated with magna cum laude honors from Westminster College with a BS in Business Management. She enjoyed a successful career in accounting, even building her own bookkeeping company, before eventually transitioning into the real estate industry when the perfect opportunity arose. Boasting a passion for sales and a natural talent for customer service, Kristy was approached by a national builder who saw potentialâ€”and wanted to sponsor her through the real estate licensing process in exchange for a six month commitment with their team. Being a motivated go-getter, she jumped at the opportunity and quickly discovered real estate was a perfect fit. Kristy rose through the ranks, staying on with Richmond American for two years before moving to Century Communities (both national home builders) for the following six. Those first eight years were spent learning the industry, building a loyal client base, and developing an in-depth understanding of Utahâ€™s ever growing real estate market. In early 2023, Kristy was ready to branch out and further grow her career; she joined the award-winning, Utah-based Sothebyâ€™s Realty affiliate, Summit Sothebyâ€™s International Realty, after searching for a full-service brokerage that could support her as an independent real estate agent. Now backed by Utahâ€™s only real estate firm with a 4:1 agent-to-support staff ratio (not to mention an in-house advertising agency offering full-time professional marketing services), Kristy is able to offer her clients a tailored, luxury experience from start-to-finish. The vast network and global reach of the Sothebyâ€™s brand means Kristy can provide her clientsâ€”at all price pointsâ€”with the highest level of professional real estate services possible. Through her years of hard work, dedication, and passion for helping her clients, Kristy has built a reputation as a top-performing real estate broker. Although she specialized in new home construction for almost a decade and has a vast wealth of knowledge in the area, Kristy is eager to help clients at all price points and from all walks of life. She enjoys helping people discover the dream of homeownership, and her commitment to excellence, keen attention to detail, and exceptional communication skills have earned her the trust and respect of her clients and peers in the industry. When sheâ€™s not helping her clients buy and sell real estate, Kristy is a dedicated mom to her three beautiful children. She enjoys traveling and spending time outside; skiing and working hard on improving her mountain biking skills in Utahâ€™s mountains. Kristyâ€™s adventurous spirit and love for the outdoors drive her to explore new places and try new things with friends and family.",1,https://www.sothebysrealty.com/summitsir,,,,,,0,Bravo Realty Services Llc,,84043,true,True,100111607,False,,5.0,http://www.kristyowens.com,641cee289f00760a45d2390a,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:53:45 GMT",agent,USA,LEHI,2989 W Maple Loop Dr. Ste. 110,,84043,UT,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/81534a599dd3ea98c2f26742683be65da-e4435954s.jpg,False,,Kristy Owens,288474461,,,,,,,0,0,"buyer, seller",True,0.0,Kristy Owens,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Kristy-Owens_LEHI_UT_100111607_288474461,,318274227,"Kristy Owens, true",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/608a72c10d8b96c6cd5a90c439434a33g-c1859566308s.jpg,,True,,,2025-10-09T02:27:29Z,829900,2099900,5,0,0,2025-10-07,11,False,,375149849.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lehi_UT, Draper_UT, Saratoga Springs_UT",Lehi_UT,"Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_208E2169,7057999,FAR_208E2169,7057999,FAR_208E2169,,FAR_208E2169,,FAR_2096202A|inactive=2024-07-08T23:41:23.000Z,FAR_2096202A,2024-07-08T23:41:23.000Z,"13693 South 200 West Suite 100, <NA>, Draper, UT 84020",(801) 662-0966,Office,(801) 662-0966 (Office),,,(801) 597-4266,Mobile,"(801) 467-2100, (801) 597-4266","(801) 467-2100 (Office), (801) 597-4266 (Mobile)"

Virginia,VA,2004.0,"Spanish, Chinese, Bosnian, Russian, English",agent,"Kyle has over 20 years of experience in the Real Estate & new construction industry and founded The Yeatman Group in 2014 after noticing a tremendous gap in the marketplace for competent representation of buyers and sellers mainly in new construction but also in the resale market. Kyle brings an unparalleled level of passion and commitment to any task or situation continually going the extra mile for his clients and proving time and time again that he will not be out worked. Kyle’s attention to detail and drive to consider things from every angle breeds a unique level of confidence in his customers rarely found in the industry. 

He has worked in numerous roles over the years including Construction Supervisor, Project Manager, Sales, Sales Trainer, Marketing Director, and Sales Manager for several of the largest builders in Richmond. His background includes having recruited, hired, trained, and developed over 200 new home & resale sales agents during this time. Kyle has sold in every product category and price range from entry level townhomes in the 100ks to estate style homes ranging well over 1 million. This range uniquely separates him from many agents who merely specialize in a single area or price point. When on the sales floor, Kyle was consistently in the Top 5 new home sales agents in the city. 

He brings a unique grasp of the financing and negotiation aspects of Real Estate providing buyers a true expert in their corner. Having sold over 5,000 homes in the last 10 years, Kyle has experienced just about all there is to encounter in sales and also the construction process making him an ideal choice for representation in almost any buying or selling situation. Kyle has enjoyed a decorated Real Estate career already having been recognized locally and regionally as a Salesperson of the Year five separate times, the Marketing Executive of the Year twice, and the Sales Manager of the Year twice by the Home Building Association of Richmond and other professional organizations.

Virginia,VA,2008.0,,agent,"Dave Seibert, founder of Dave Seibert Real Estate Group was born and raised in Richmond, brings 16 years of sales experience to the table along with an extensive background in building, renovation, design and real estate investing. Knowing the product like the back of his hand, he can draw from his experience building, renovating or selling over 1000+ homes in Richmond. Dave became an agent as an extension of his real estate investment business, already being an expert on the local market people were always coming to him for advice.


Drawn to the Real Estate Industry from the beginning. From learning how to build and fix houses in high school, to buying his first home at age 24 and completely flipping it, he went from selling 11 houses his first year as a Realtor to consistently selling over 100 homes annually. To Dave, being a Realtor means being there for people. Whether it be helping friends and family reach another milestone in life, or helping someone he just met buy their first home, Dave is there for it all.


Dave and his wife Amanda love to travel, with 49/50 states under their belt he believes that this transformed the way he sees Real Estate and what he brings to the Richmond market.

Virginia,VA,2007.0,,agent,"I take pride in setting myself apart from other realtors.  Being on the forefront of technology plays a major role. I take the designer listing approach with every listing. I do this by using professional pictures and by creating individual property websites that include unlimited amounts of information. It becomes the virtual brochure with a custom URL that can go out in any social media forum. I also use highly visibility for sale signs with QR codes to get exposure to your online brochure.  I expand my listings on Trulia and Zillow, and also promote them on Facebook to ensure that my listings get maximum exposure online.  With most of today's home buyers searching for homes online, I understand how important online exposure is and use this as a large part of my marketing plan.For my buyers, I strive to make their home search as simple as possible with up-to-date online resources for both them and myself.  I make myself available to them for viewing potential properties and work hard to negotiate the best price possible.

Vermont,VT,2017.0,English,agent,"Kimberly Maffia is a Sonoma County native, raised in Petaluma. Growing up in a family that believed in investing in local Real Estate, she learned early on the value of homeownership. At the age of 22 she bought her first home in Santa Rosa, a small house with an accessory dwelling unit. Despite her initial preference to buy a bigger, newer home, she bought a smaller home with a rental unit in a great location. Upon becoming a single mother she quickly saw the wisdom of having rental income. This extra household income played a critical financial role and assisted her to raise her two girls, Brianna now 22 and Madelyn now 19 on her own.

With her own experience in buying a fixer and being raised in a construction family, Kimberly has a natural eye for the potential of fixer homes. She loves nothing more than to find the “diamond in the rough” for her clients, and is a strong advocate of properties with rental income. She has a keen esthetic eye and will advise you how to best present the home you need to sell and help you get top dollar for your home. Her extensive knowledge of Sonoma and Marin Counties allows her to help clients find the right North Bay community for their next home. Kimberly has an extensive social network and can recommend everything from neighborhood restaurants, local businesses, or even a great hiking trail.

Given the fast pace of the Real Estate market in northern CA, success in buying or selling a home starts with preparation. A strong offer starts with a good financial strategy. Working closely with local lenders, it’s easy for Kimberly to help clients find the best loan and financial plan. Kimberly is available, open, honest and most importantly fun to be around! She prides herself on doing what’s in the client’s best interest and is proud to help you buy or sell your home. If you are thinking of buying or selling your home, with Kimberly Maffia, you have a friend and trusted advisor in Real Estate.",0,https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com//ca/santa-rosa/office/santa-rosa/oid_5939/,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/d4486cb5d46f86182e39c463827f8708o-b2734056868s.jpg,,,,160958,Coldwell Banker Realty,,"95401, 95403, 95405, 95404, 95407, 95409, 05492",Agent,True,3123277,False,,0.0,https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/ca/santa-rosa/agent/kimberly-maffia/aid_223055/?utm_campaign=OLDP-RDC&utm_source=RDC&utm_medium=oldp&utm_content=agentwebsite,59382dd795aefa001104c7c7,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:34:05 GMT",agent,US,Santa Rosa,600 Bicentennial Way Ste 100,California,95403,CA,,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/2a72cfebbc36003778975fad43e34207a-w1891010135s.jpg,,,Kimberly Maffia,725864818,,,,,,,1562445,0,,True,1.0,Kimberly Maffia,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Kimberly-Maffia_Santa-Rosa_CA_3123277_725864818,,399661720,"Kimberly Maffia, Agent",1,,,False,,,2025-10-08T22:17:46Z,640000,1195000,4,285000,1200000,2025-09-26,29,False,,491801.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,US,CA,2033450.0,,,,,"Santa Rosa_CA, Fulton_CA, Larkfield_CA, Larkfield-Wikiup_CA, Windsor_CA, Sonoma State University_CA, Rohnert Park_CA, Waterville_VT, Petaluma_CA, Cotati_CA, Healdsburg_CA, Graton_CA, Sebastopol_CA, Guerneville_CA, Forestville_CA, Rio Nido_CA, Monte Rio_CA, Cazadero_CA, Timber Cove_CA, Novato_CA","Santa Rosa_CA, Waterville_VT, Sonoma County, Petaluma_CA, Rohnert Park_CA, Cotati_CA, Healdsburg_CA, Windsor_CA, Graton_CA, Sebastopol_CA, Guerneville_CA, Forestville_CA, Rio Nido_CA, Monte Rio_CA, Cazadero_CA, Timber Cove_CA, Novato_CA","Residential, Condos, Townhomes, Single-family homes, Multi-family homes, Vacation homes, New construction, Luxury homes, New homes, Lots, Acreage, Investment properties, Rentals",,FAR_19EE1A4E,02033450,"FAR_19911A4E, FAR_19ED1A4E, FAR_19EE1A4E, FAR_1A021A4E, FAR_1A6419F4, FAR_20901A4E, FAR_20971A4E","02033450, 2033450.0",FAR_19EE1A4E,,"FAR_19EE1A4E, FAR_1A6419F4, FAR_20901A4E, FAR_20931A4E, FAR_20971A4E",,FAR_20931A4E|DRE #02033450|inactive=2025-07-14T23:35:42.000Z,FAR_20931A4E,2025-07-14T23:35:42.000Z,"600 Bicentennial Way Ste 100, <NA>, Santa Rosa, CA 95403, US",(707) 527-8567,Office,"(707) 527-8567 (Office), (707) 527-0617 (Fax)",,,(707) 494-1770,Office,(707) 494-1770,(707) 494-1770 (Office)
Vermont,VT,0.0,,agent,"As a lifelong native of Vermont, with nearly 15 years experience as a Real Estate Agent, licensed in both Vermont and New Hampshire, I offer my customers and clients a keen knowledge of the area and the local real estate market. I take pride in providing personalized service, catering to the individual requirements of my clients and customers, along with providing a creative marketing approach. Trained in representation of homebuyers as well as sellers, I earned my CBR designation (certified buyer representative) in 1996. If you are considering selling or buying real estate, I would be happy to be of assistance.

I've raised two children who attended both local public and private schools. I am now enjoying a granddaughter, who is enrolled at The Green Valley School in Westminster West where I reside. Its mission is to ""cultivate health, freedom, and a reverence for the natural world for children, family and the community."" This program suits my sensibilties well. I never take for granted how fortunate I am to live in such a wonderful place. I come from several generations of Vermonters, most of who live in the area. My family is comprised of Maple Sugar makers, Masons, Woodworkers, Builders and Teachers.

Some of my favorite activities include cooking and gardening. With all the teriffic local farmstands and co-ops, finding local quality food is not a problem. Hiking/walking, cross-county skiing, snowshoeing, kyacking and cycling are favorite outdoor activities of mine.

I love the Real Estate business, and very much enjoy sharing my knowledge of the area and all it offers with potential clients and customers.

Vermont,VT,1991.0,,agent,"Consistently recognized as one of Vermont’s top Realtors, Brian is hailed by his clients for his negotiating skills, professionalism and deep industry knowledge.  A Burlington native and a graduate of University of Vermont, Brian returned to his hometown in 1991 after living in Manhattan, where he spent a decade as a currency trader. While the activity of New York City and a busy financial career had appeal, Brian and his wife decided Burlington’s family-friendly culture, lively arts scene and active outdoor lifestyle was where they wanted to raise their children. Brian’s passion for success shows through as an Owner.  He joined the family business upon his return to Vermont in 1991.  As his grandfather was the driving force behind the insurance company, Hickok & Boardman Insurance, Inc., Brian was instrumental in growing the real-estate company now known as Coldwell Banker Hickok & Boardman Realty. Since he joined the company, it has leapfrogged over the competition to rank as Northwest Vermont’s top full service real estate company. Brian’s years as a currency trader helped hone skills he uses daily as a Realtor: flexibility, the ability to juggle multiple demands and negotiating expertise. He has consistently ranked as a top producer and is Burlington’s top performing agent. He is known for his in-depth knowledge of Burlington’s Hill Section and his knack for finding the perfect home for his clients, whether they are seeking lakefront property or a classic Burlington bungalow.  His wide range of skills has also assisted many Burlington-area residents in successfully selling their homes. Brian’s strengths in handling sales and purchases are revealed in his philosophy. “My goal is to make the process smoother and to have everyone happy at the closing table,” he notes. His ease in handling properties ranging from condominiums to multi-million dollar estates have helped him earn the distinction as Vermont’s only “Mega-Realtor,” according to luxury real estate magazine Unique Homes.

Vermont,VT,2007.0,,agent,"A Michigan native, Terry Davis has made the Upper Valley her home for more than 30 years. A deep love of the outdoors, the quality of life, and an appreciation for the natural beauty Vermont provides convinced her that this was the place to spend her time. An avid downhill and telemark skier, hiker, kayaker and mountain biker, Terry has traversed the state on one form of transportation or another, gathering a wealth of knowledge about both the beaten path and the pristine woods, who and what lives there, and how we must work to preserve our surroundings.

Her multiple interests and skills are reflected in her work history. Terry has an excellent reputation as a carpenter and woodworker, sports instructor, landscape designer/gardener, property manager and telephone technician. Each segment of her working life has gained her respect for her work ethic, and provided opportunity for challenge and personal growth while fulfilling her desire to engage in nature and the outdoors.

As a licensed Realtor, Terry™s entire catalog of knowledge can be put into play, from her understanding of the woods and waterways, to construction and landscape work.

I'm a Spokane native and have lived here most of my life. I bought my first investment property at the age of eighteen and have loved real estate ever since. I have been involved in other businesses over the years, yet I was always drawn back to real estate. I studied all aspects of the real estate business at Texas Tech University and received my first licensing in Austin, Texas in 1997. After returning to Spokane, I received my Real Estate Broker's License in 2001 and began Cooper Realty Services. I currently live in Spokane WA with my family. My hobbies include enjoying outdoor sports and activities that the Great Northwest has to offer.

Washington,WA,2005.0,,agent,"I am happy to be helping buyers and sellers in my hometown of Cheney, WA and the surrounding Spokane area! I began my real estate career in 2005 when I moved to Manhattan while attending Baruch University. After a couple more moves (South Carolina and then Seattle) I decided to settle down in Cheney to be close to my siblings, parents, and friends and finish my marketing degree at EWU. Real Estate transactions can be rather stressful and cumbersome for buyers and sellers so my goal is to relieve the stress and help my clients obtain their goals with at much ease as possible. I pride myself on the first class service that I provide to each and every client that I work with. When listing a property I handle everything from professional flyers and marketing materials to maneuvering the appraisal process. Buyers receive utmost support and help from the very beginning--answering questions about home buying to guidance through the loan process.  If you are looking at buying, selling, or just have questions regarding the real estate process please feel free to contact me!",0,WWW.TOUCHSTONEINW.COM,,,,,,4684758,Touchstone Real Estate Group,,"99003, 99005, 99006, 99008, 99009, 99011, 99012, 99013, 99016, 99018, 99019, 99020, 99021, 99022, 99023, 99025, 99026, 99027, 99029, 99030, 99031, 99033, 99036, 99037, 99110, 99156, 99170, 99206, 99208, 99212, 99216, 99217, 99218, 99223, 99224, 99004",Broker,True,1033988,False,,0.0,http://www.spokanelifestyle.com,5673350e0fa4170100714c1f,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:12:46 GMT",agent,USA,CHENEY,513 1ST ST,,99004,WA,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d8e7847c9e2d299d0112e58de36d5436a-e1627632436s.jpg,False,,Danielle LaBar,113974921,,,Touchstone Real Estate Group - Broker,,,,4683494,0,"buyer, seller",True,6.0,Danielle LaBar,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Danielle-LaBar_CHENEY_WA_1033988_113974921,,3366456,"Danielle LaBar, Broker",1,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/g04c70f00-c0od-w1200_q50.jpg,Your Dream is Our Goal!,False,,,2025-10-09T04:25:44Z,135000,799000,8,65000,695000,2025-09-18,38,False,,517815206.0,Danielle,LaBar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chattaroy_WA, Green Bluff_WA, Colbert_WA, Deer Park_WA, Suncrest_WA, Edwall_WA, Elk_WA, Fairchild AFB_WA, Fairfield_WA, Waverly_WA, Ford_WA, Greenacres_WA, Liberty Lake_WA, Spokane Valley_WA, Latah_WA, Marshall_WA, Mead_WA, Medical Lake_WA, Espanola_WA, Mica_WA, Newman Lake_WA, Otis Orchards-East Farms_WA, Nine Mile Falls_WA, City of Spokane Valley_WA, Otis Orchards_WA, Reardan_WA, Rockford_WA, Spangle_WA, Tekoa_WA, Valleyford_WA, Veradale_WA, Loon Lake_WA, Clayton_WA, Newport_WA, Plaza_WA, Malden_WA, Rosalia_WA, Millwood_WA, Country Homes_WA, Fairwood_WA, Town and Country_WA, Spokane_WA, Airway Heights_WA, Sunset Hill_WA, Four Lakes_WA, Cheney_WA","Chattaroy_WA, Colbert_WA, Deer Park_WA, Edwall_WA, Elk_WA, Fairchild AFB_WA, Fairfield_WA, Ford_WA, Greenacres_WA, Latah_WA, Liberty Lake_WA, Marshall_WA, Mead_WA, Medical Lake_WA, Mica_WA, Newman Lake_WA, Nine Mile Falls_WA, Otis Orchards_WA, Reardan_WA, Rockford_WA, Spangle_WA, Tekoa_WA, Valleyford_WA, Veradale_WA, Clayton_WA, Newport_WA, Rosalia_WA, Spokane_WA, Cheney_WA","New Construction, Developments, First Time Buyer, Investment, Buyers Agent, Resale, Rural, Cheney WA, Turn of Century Homes, Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",,FAR_209D221E,26095,"FAR_1A511CA9, FAR_209D221E","DB59374, 26095",FAR_209D221E,,"FAR_1A511CA9, FAR_209D221E",,FAR_20F4221E|26095|inactive=2025-04-16T09:30:57.000Z,FAR_20F4221E,2025-04-16T09:30:57.000Z,"513 1ST ST, <NA>, CHENEY, WA 99004, USA",,,,,,(509) 979-8173,Mobile,"(509) 979-8173, (509) 559-9225","(509) 979-8173 (Mobile), (509) 559-9225 (Office)"
Washington,WA,2019.0,,agent,"Dana Fitzpatrick’s approach to real estate balances strong business acumen with tremendous advocacy for her clients. She has always cherished a sense of “home,” both as a physical location and part of a greater community, and recognizes how important it is that we land in a place where we can thrive. To this end, Dana endeavors to help others find their home and enrich the community in the process. While acknowledging that real estate transactions are inherently personal, Dana supports the emotional element with a strong analytical background and comprehensive understanding of investment and financial management.  
 
Prior to entering the real estate industry, Dana earned an MBA and spent two decades working as a marketing executive. During this time, she established a successful record in business development, marketing, sales and operations management. 

Dana loves the life she’s established on Bainbridge Island and is especially thrilled when given the opportunity to help those new to the area find their place in the community. When not in the office, she enjoys spending time with her husband and their children, and can also be found teaching spin class, training for her next triathlon, or indulging in her passion for delicious food and a great glass of wine.",0,http://www.compass.com,,,,,,100310030,Compass - Seattle WA,,"98110, 98370",Broker,True,3915797,False,,0.0,http://www.danafitzpatrick.com,5de8bc2bf5cd8e0014fd75c3,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:45:38 GMT",agent,US,SEATTLE,837 N 34th St #100,,98103,WA,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/f6afe8928460243b8d66ff90266161dca-c22022602rd-w160_h120.jpg,True,,Dana Fitzpatrick,334599631,Transparent,,Compass - Seattle WA,,,,100310032,97,,True,10.0,Dana Fitzpatrick,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Dana-Fitzpatrick_SEATTLE_WA_3915797_334599631,,500836818,"Dana Fitzpatrick, Broker",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/d164552ff55f98c0cdcaa1e75f338fb2g-c3179152411s.jpg,Service and Tenacity,False,,,2025-10-09T03:38:14Z,330000,3200000,14,425000,3650000,2025-10-03,77,False,,,,,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1tk7o7cZ44?modestbranding=1&rel=0,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bainbridge Island_WA, Rollingbay_WA, Poulsbo_WA, Lofall_WA, Indianola_WA, Suquamish_WA, Bangor Base_WA, Silverdale_WA","Bainbridge Island_WA, Poulsbo_WA, Kitsap County","Waterfront, Buyers, Downsizing, Second Home, Family Relocation, Luxury, Marketing",,FAR_2092221E,138844,FAR_2092221E,138844,FAR_2092221E,,FAR_2092221E,,,,,"837 N 34th St #100, <NA>, SEATTLE, WA 98103, US",(206) 330-0314,Mobile,(206) 330-0314 (Mobile),,,(206) 488-8632,Mobile,(206) 488-8632,(206) 488-8632 (Mobile)

I look forward to assisting you in finding a little piece of the charm, whether you're a familiar face that knows the wonderment the area has to offer, or a new face looking for the small-town hospitality topped off with the serene beauty the River Valley is well-known for; I'd love to help in any way!",0,https://www.c21affiliated.com/,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/63c75275513dc9465f1f527429c9e32fo-b3388327510s.jpg,,,79936990.0,105915,CENTURY 21 Affiliated,SMARTER.BOLDER.FASTER,"53588, 53577, 53556, 53503, 53578, 53581, 53583, 53555, 53958, 53959, 53913",true,True,4269377,False,,0.0,https://homesforsale.century21.com/CENTURY-21-Affiliated-10875c/Ashley-Straka-7558219a,600f178c1c6df700118aef29,"Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:37:42 GMT",agent,US,Spring Green,550 Sunrise Dr. Suite 101,,53588,WI,,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/9f10c86b302e0b7d4754bbfdeae6fa4ca-b2614218455s.jpg,True,,Ashley Straka,90791890,#bcb08a,,CENTURY 21 Affiliated,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1002380816/70603560446b9242e89525de1cd75d5fk-c0s.jpg,,,1461486,0,"buyer, seller",True,12.0,Ashley Straka,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/Ashley-Straka_Spring-Green_WI_4269377_90791890,,516345259,"Ashley Straka, true",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/3d00102e56d06e217b6e495090b6fea0g-c3948286826s.jpg,,False,,,2025-10-09T12:58:47Z,615000,725000,2,153000,745000,2025-08-27,5,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spring Green_WI, Lone Rock_WI, Plain_WI, Gotham_WI, Avoca_WI, Sextonville_WI, Arena_WI, Lake Wisconsin_WI, Prairie du Sac_WI, Bloom City_WI, Richland Center_WI, Boaz_WI, Sauk City_WI, Lodi_WI, Reedsburg_WI, West Baraboo_WI, Baraboo_WI, Lake Delton_WI","Spring Green_WI, Plain_WI, Lone Rock_WI, Arena_WI, Prairie du Sac_WI, Richland Center_WI, Sauk City_WI, Lodi_WI, Reedsburg_WI, Baraboo_WI, River Valley and surrounding areas.","Buyer's agent, Seller's agent",PSA,FAR_1E392226,92572-94,"FAR_1A521EAD, FAR_1E392226",92572-94,FAR_1E392226,,FAR_1E392226,,,,,"550 Sunrise Dr. Suite 101, <NA>, Spring Green, WI 53588, US",(608) 588-7021,Office,(608) 588-7021 (Office),,,(608) 574-4734,Mobile,"(608) 588-7021, (608) 574-4734","(608) 588-7021 (Office), (608) 574-4734 (Mobile)"

Wisconsin,WI,2012.0,,agent,"As a lifelong resident in the Coulee Region and an active member in the community, I bring a wealth of knowledge and a strong network of potential buyers to your home. I am a broker licensed in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Being a real estate agent is not just a job but is what I truly am passionate about. 

My goal is to build a relationship with my clients that lasts a lifetime. From helping clients buy their first home to assisting them in selling their home and moving up, to then downsizing when they become empty nesters, the only way to build those relationships is to give each client the results they want.

Owning my own business for most of my twenties, I have learned two essential staples in creating good client relationships.
1. Deliver consistent, world-class service - Do what you say you're going to do and give the same excellent customer service day in day out.
2. Be a good person - Do what's right, build your business with integrity and honesty. It's pretty simple, do what you would do for your mother. If you don't have your word, you have nothing.

I have four children and a loving and supportive wife who works alongside me and my team. I enjoy boating, video games, and spending time with my wife and kids. In addition to real estate, I also own and manage property.

West Virginia,WV,2004.0,,agent,"My name is Jay Deeds and I reside in Spring Mills subdivision, having lived in the Eastern Panhandle of WV most of my life--more specifically a little community called Bedington, outside of Martinsburg.  

I am a graduate of The George Washington University with a bachelor's degree in international business/finance and received an MBA from the University of Maryland.

After investing in real estate and managing rental properties since 2002, I became a full-time agent in 2004. In 2012, I opened Home Quest Realty, a small boutique real estate firm, as both broker and owner in West Virginia and Maryland.  Actively involved in the real estate community, I was selected to be a Director, Eastern Panhandle Board of REALTORS (EPBR) and selected and graduated from the West Virginia Association of REALTORS ® (WVAR) 2014 Leadership Academy inaugural class.  I was also named the EPBR's 2016 REALTOR® of the Year.  

2017 was a big year.  We launched Keller Williams Realty Eastern Panhandle. My Home Quest Team is now backed by a leading international franchise; I am the operating principal/owner and broker.

With continued success, we have expanded into surrounding states—we serve West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.  We have several offices throughout the state and continue to grow--renaming to Keller Williams Realty ADVANTAGE.  If you need a great agent or team of agents, you’ve come to the right place!  Please don’t hesitate to ask me about joining KW!

More responsibility is on the hands of the managing Broker including supervising agents, contract review, earnest money deposits, training agents just to name a few.  I have been selling real estate since 2004 and focused previously on very complicated transactions with all sorts of title challenges.  I know what it takes to get a seller to the finish line!

I have much lower overhead than the large franchise and no split goes to the house as it is my own company.  This allows for a slight reduction in commission easier for me than a large traditional brokerage.  When the demand is high and inventory is low, the costs associated in marketing the listings for the brokerage are lower as they are typically under contract when priced right in under thirty days. When market fluctuations occur, the fee increases.","I start off at the first meeting providing all of my potential clients a competitive market analysis.  This is my best estimate of what your home will sell for.  This is not an algorithm but an actual report on recent competing sales and active listings.  I offer all of my sellers in all price points a free consultation with a professional home stager.  I only use professional photographers and offer virtual tours on all listings.  I showcase your listing on all of the main platforms including Realtor.com, Zillow.com.  My company has two separate websites where your listing is showcased including video tours on www.metrodmvrealty.com and www.welistdmv.com.  I use paid ads for Facebook around  your open house to generate more traffic for you and mail out to your neighbors for higher turnout for the open house and ultimately multiple

West Virginia,WV,2002.0,,agent,"I am a life long resident of Berkeley Springs.   Perry Realty is a family owned real estate company that has served our hometown since 1973.  As a second generation family member I am proud to continue the traditions that made Perry Realty so successful. After being actively involved in the day to day operations at Perry Realty since 1985, I obtained my real estate license in June of 2002.

In 2019 I decided it was time to take the next step. My broker decided she was going to retire. She offered me the business and I said YES! In February 2020 I became the owner and Broker of Perry Realty LLC. 

I am a professional Realtor® dedicated to providing outstanding customer service. During my real estate career I have worked hard to ensure that my Buyers and Sellers are truly happy with their personal real estate transactions. Thanks to both hard work and my many satisfied customers and clients I have been a proud member of the Top Producers Club for outstanding achievement since 2003!",1,http://www.perryrealty.com,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/2082299238/ad89a7dc4fa1a907a1fef09f9ee367f7o-c0o.jpg,,,56869101.0,472692,Perry Realty LLC,HOME TOWN TEAM,"25411, 25422, 25427",Broker,True,1004350,False,,5.0,https://homes.perryrealty.com/idx/agent/168244/teresa-white-curtis-broker,56ca39bebb954c01006d1966,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:25:10 GMT",agent,US,Berkeley Springs,71 N.

Wyoming,WY,0.0,,agent,"Before he was a realtor, Chris Grant was a fly-fishing guide. While leading trips for the historic Crescent H Ranch, Chris would explore Jacksonâ€™s many legendary rivers and tributaries. He took the skills he learned showing people where to catch wild cutthroat and brown trout to the real estate market in 2004, becoming a licensed broker in Idaho and Wyoming and introducing his clients to a different kind of treasure: their dream home. Born and raised in Jackson, Chris started skiing and fly-fishing as a toddler. His mother is from Hawaii; his father from Kansasâ€”they moved to Jackson in 1967 for teaching jobs with the Teton County School District and never left. Chris eventually moved to Oregon to attend Southern Oregon University, where he got a bachelorâ€™s degree in geography, with an emphasis in land use planning and mappingâ€”knowledge thatâ€™s come in handy in his real estate career. â€œIt took leaving and attending college for me to fully appreciate what this town and community has to offer,â€� Chris says. So, he moved back to the place that truly felt like home. After working as a fly-fishing guide for several years, Chris got his real estate license and started his career at Teton Village Realty before joining Jackson Hole Sotheby's International Realty in 2009. Heâ€™s a founding member of the JH Property Group, a top-producing real estate team thatâ€™s ranked among the top 10 real estate groups in the state of Wyoming by Real Trends. He met his wife, Courtney, when he moved back to Jackson and they married in 2008. They are raising their daughter and son and two dogs in the same tight-knit community where Chris grew up.",0,https://jhsir.com/,,http://ap.rdcpix.com/1134361416/af952f8e979994ca12583ff17b988243o-b0s.jpg,,,387999390.0,45833,Jackson Hole Sotheby's International Realty,Visit Sotheby's International Realty,"83001, 83014, 83025",true,True,1485332,False,,0.0,http://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng/associate/180-a-762-4018343/chris-grant,56741cbc7e54f701001e47af,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:48:35 GMT",agent,US,Jackson,110 E.

Wyoming,WY,0.0,,agent,"I was born and raised in a small town in Kansas. I attended John Brown University in Northwest Arkansas where I earned a degree in Business Administration and met my wife Rachel. After graduation I worked in the banking industry for two years before becoming a Police Officer for the local police department.

In 2011, my law enforcement career brought us to Northern Colorado where we could be closer to our Wyoming family. During my nearly 11-year law enforcement career I had the privilege of serving as a Patrol Officer, a member of the SWAT Team and a Crime Scene Technician. In 2015, I decided it was time to serve my community by helping people meet their goals through buying as selling real estate.

In my spare time I enjoy camping, hiking and all of Wyoming’s incredible outdoor activities with my wife and our two young kids.

Wyoming,WY,1985.0,,agent,"With 39 years of experience as a real estate broker, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the Cody area market. Since making Cody my home in 1998, I’ve remained dedicated to staying informed about local trends and maintaining strong, positive relationships with my fellow brokers.

Representing both buyers and sellers, I understand that real estate transactions are deeply personal and sometimes challenging experiences. That’s why I prioritize communication and take the time to truly understand my client’s needs and goals, ensuring a smooth and successful outcome.

My career in real estate began in Connecticut, where I owned and operated one of the fastest-growing real estate companies globally. Throughout my tenure, I consistently achieved outstanding sales records and was honored as a member of the RE/MAX executive club

Bringing my extensive marketing and sales experience to Wyoming, I’ve consistently ranked in the Top 10 for sales. My dedication to excellence and commitment to serving my clients has earned me a reputation as a trusted and reliable professional in the industry. Outside of real estate, I lead an active lifestyle, embracing the natural beauty and recreational opportunities that Cody has to offer. Whether it’s riding horses, or motorcycles, hiking, or snowmobiling, I relish every moment spent outdoors in the majestic mountain ranges of Yellowstone country.

Every day, my faithful companion Aspen, a beautiful black lab, joins me on my real estate adventures. She’s not just a pet – she’s an integral part of my team. Clients adore her and often request her presence during property viewings. In fact, one generous client even surprises her with toys on every holiday.

As an active member of the Cody Shooting Complex, I take pride in sharing my knowledge and skills with others, particularly women interested in learning how to shoot. I believe in fostering a supportive and inclusive community where everyone feels empowered to pursue their interests and passions.",3,http://www.codywyomingrealestate.com,,http://p.rdcpix.com/v01/o95891100-c0l.gif,,,769994590.0,1149333,Coldwell Banker Antlers Realty Inc,Where Home Town Service Works For You,"82414, 82435, 82450, 82453",Broker Associate,True,1174585,False,,5.0,http://www.codyrealty.com,56cd0d4d89a68901006f78bf,"Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:46:31 GMT",agent,US,Cody,802 Canyon Avenue,,82414,WY,,,https://ap.rdcpix.com/1695546703/5db74043883d32193cf63f33a3c9419ba-e0s.jpg,True,,JoAnn Humphries,508994590,#142f54,,Coldwell Banker Antlers Realty Inc - Bro,https://ap.rdcpix.com/b03927833e3a520930241631d9eeedcck-c3461573789s.jpg,True,,1647790,3,"buyer, seller",True,1.0,JoAnn Humphries,https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/JoAnn-Humphries_Cody_WY_1174585_508994590,JoAnn,3162198,"JoAnn Humphries, Broker Associate",1,https://ap.rdcpix.com/373959046/b75bc8016bbee742f934faa4b8ca05b7g-c0s.jpg,Realtor For Life!,True,,"Experience, plenty of reviews.
